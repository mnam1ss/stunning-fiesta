Newly disclosed emails indicate that officers from London's Metropolitan Police, while assigned to provide personal protection for Prince Andrew, were also instructed to guard a residence owned by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The information emerged from a review of correspondence related to the Duke of York's security arrangements.

The Metropolitan Police has stated that its ongoing review into the matter has not, so far, found evidence of misconduct by the protection officers involved. The force emphasized that its assessment is continuing.

The revelation adds another layer to the scrutiny of links between British institutions and Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender and died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on further charges.

Key points:
*   Emails show Met Police officers detailed for Prince Andrew's protection were also directed to secure a property owned by Jeffrey Epstein.
*   The Metropolitan Police says its review has not yet identified any wrongdoing by the officers.
*   The disclosure contributes to ongoing examination of connections to the late financier.
