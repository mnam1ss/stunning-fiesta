Prime Minister Keir Starmer has issued an apology to victims of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, following revelations about his former ambassador’s connections. The apology centers on Lord Peter Mandelson, whom Starmer appointed as the UK’s ambassador to the United States earlier this year.

Starmer stated that the full extent of Mandelson’s past relationship with Epstein was not known at the time of the appointment. He expressed regret for having believed previous assurances on the matter, acknowledging that this has caused further distress to those harmed by Epstein’s crimes. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of transparency for individuals in public roles.

The statement follows renewed scrutiny of links between British political figures and the convicted sex offender. Mandelson has previously denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.

**Key points:**

- Starmer stated the depth of Mandelson's past ties to Epstein was not fully known during the appointment process.
