**Federal Immigration Presence Reduced in Minnesota**

The federal government has reduced its immigration enforcement personnel in Minnesota, with former acting ICE Director Tom Homan stating approximately 2,000 officers will remain in the state. The adjustment follows recent remarks by former President Donald Trump, who has described a shift toward a "softer touch" in immigration enforcement operations. Concurrently, the U.S. government is expanding the use of body-worn cameras, issuing the equipment to more federal officers involved in these duties. Officials have not provided a detailed public statement on the long-term strategy behind the personnel change or the camera rollout. The developments occur amid ongoing national debate over immigration policy and enforcement methods.

Key points:
*   Federal immigration enforcement personnel in Minnesota have been reduced, with an estimated 2,000 officers remaining.
*   The move aligns with described efforts to adopt a less aggressive approach to immigration operations.
*   More federal officers are being equipped with body-worn cameras as part of the initiative.
