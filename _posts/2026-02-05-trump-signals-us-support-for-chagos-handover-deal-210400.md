President Donald Trump has indicated a potential shift in the United States' position regarding the disputed Chagos Archipelago. The development follows a statement last month in which the president suggested he might withdraw U.S. support for an agreement to transfer control of the islands to Mauritius.

The Chagos Archipelago, home to the U.S. military base on Diego Garcia, has been a point of contention for decades. The United Kingdom, which administers the territory, and Mauritius, which claims sovereignty, have been engaged in negotiations. The U.S. stance is considered influential due to its strategic interests in the region. The recent signals from the White House introduce new uncertainty into the diplomatic process surrounding the islands' future status.

Key points:
*   President Trump has signaled a potential change in U.S. support for a deal to hand the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius.
*   The U.S. maintains a strategic military base on Diego Garcia, a key factor in its policy.
*   The shift introduces uncertainty into ongoing negotiations between the UK and Mauritius over sovereignty.
