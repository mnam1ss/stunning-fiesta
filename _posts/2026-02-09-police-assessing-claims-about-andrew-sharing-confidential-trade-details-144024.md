**Police Review Claims Regarding Duke of York and Confidential Information**

Authorities are examining allegations concerning the Duke of York's conduct during his former role as a UK trade envoy. The review follows the emergence of documents that reportedly indicate he may have shared sensitive commercial information from his official duties with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is assessing the contents of the files, which have recently been made public as part of a US civil case. A spokesperson stated the force is reviewing the material but has not yet opened a formal investigation. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the matter.

Key points:
*   Police are evaluating documents alleging the sharing of confidential trade information.
*   The claims relate to the Duke of York's former role as a UK trade envoy and his association with Jeffrey Epstein.
*   No formal criminal investigation has been launched at this stage.
