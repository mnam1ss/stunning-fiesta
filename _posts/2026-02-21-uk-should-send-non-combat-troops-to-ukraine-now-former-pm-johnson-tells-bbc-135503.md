Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for the British government to deploy military personnel to Ukraine in non-combat capacities. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson suggested that troops could be stationed in areas of the country not currently engaged in active fighting. He argued that such a presence could fulfill support and training roles without directly participating in hostilities.

The proposal represents a significant escalation in suggested Western military involvement, which has so far focused on arms supplies and training conducted outside Ukraine. The UK government has not issued an immediate response to the suggestion. Current British policy, in line with other NATO allies, has been to avoid placing troops on Ukrainian soil to prevent a direct confrontation with Russia.

Key points:
*   Former PM Boris Johnson advocates sending UK troops to Ukraine for non-fighting roles.
*   He suggests personnel could operate in regions away from front-line combat.
*   The call marks a notable shift from the current Western stance of avoiding troop deployments inside Ukraine.
