The UK government has announced a new annual fund to assist with travel expenses for families seeking cancer treatment for children and young adults. A dedicated £10 million per year will be allocated to support individuals under the age of 24 and their families, aiming to reduce the financial burden associated with reaching necessary medical care.

The initiative is designed to ensure that travel costs do not become a barrier to accessing specialized treatment centers. Officials stated the funding will help cover expenses such as fuel, train fares, and accommodation for eligible patients and their accompanying family members during treatment periods.

Key points:
*   A yearly fund of £10 million has been established by the government.
*   It covers travel costs for cancer patients under 24 and their families.
*   The goal is to improve access to treatment by alleviating financial pressures.
