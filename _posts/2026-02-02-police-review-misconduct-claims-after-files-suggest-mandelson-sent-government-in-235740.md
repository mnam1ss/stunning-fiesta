Police in the United Kingdom are reviewing misconduct allegations following the emergence of files suggesting a former senior minister shared government information with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The documents reportedly indicate that Lord Peter Mandelson, who served as Business Secretary, passed sensitive material to Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

The review is in its preliminary stages and no formal investigation has been launched. The allegations stem from a review of documents related to Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Lord Mandelson has previously denied any wrongdoing during his time in government.

Key points:
- UK police are assessing misconduct claims linked to Lord Peter Mandelson.
- Files reportedly suggest sensitive government information was shared with Jeffrey Epstein.
- The peer has denied any previous allegations of improper conduct.
