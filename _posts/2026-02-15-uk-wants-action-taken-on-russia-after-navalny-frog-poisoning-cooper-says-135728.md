UK Foreign Secretary David Cooper has stated that the British government is seeking further international measures against Russia in response to the death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny. Navalny died in a remote Arctic penal colony in February; Western leaders have attributed his death to the Russian state, a claim Moscow denies.

Speaking to the BBC, Cooper emphasized that the UK is focused on coordinated action with its allies. He indicated that options under consideration include expanding the existing sanctions regime targeting Russian officials and entities. The statement reinforces the UK's ongoing diplomatic stance, which has consistently condemned Russia's internal actions and its war in Ukraine.

Key points:
*   The UK is advocating for new international measures against Russia following Alexei Navalny's death.
*   Foreign Secretary David Cooper stated options include expanding sanctions on Russian officials and entities.
*   The UK aims to act in coordination with its allies on this matter.
