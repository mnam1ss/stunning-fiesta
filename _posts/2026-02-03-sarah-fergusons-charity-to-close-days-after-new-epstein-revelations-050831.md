The charity founded by Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, will cease operations indefinitely. The organization, Sarah’s Trust, made the announcement following a period of internal review that lasted several months. The decision to close was described as being made for the foreseeable future.

This development comes shortly after the release of new court documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which included a mention of the Duchess. The documents are part of a settled civil case and do not allege any wrongdoing by Ferguson. A spokesperson for the Duchess stated she had been “unaware of the wrongdoing” of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

**Key points:**
*   Sarah’s Trust, a charity founded by Sarah Ferguson, is closing after months of deliberation.
*   The announcement follows new revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein case that referenced the Duchess.
*   A representative for Ferguson stated she had no knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities.
