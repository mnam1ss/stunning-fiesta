The Louvre Museum in Paris has released the first images of a historic crown damaged during a recent theft. The artifact, an 18th-century crown belonging to King Louis XV, was recovered by authorities but was found to be severely misshapen. Museum officials described the object as having sustained significant structural damage, though its core components remain together.

The crown, made of gold and adorned with precious stones, was stolen from a display case in a brazen overnight raid. French police have arrested several suspects in connection with the incident. The Louvre has stated that experts are now assessing the full extent of the damage to determine the feasibility and process for restoration.

Key points:
*   The Louvre has published photos showing a recovered 18th-century crown left badly misshapen after a theft.
*   French authorities have made multiple arrests in connection with the raid on the museum.
*   Museum conservators are evaluating the damage to plan a potential restoration of the historic artifact.
