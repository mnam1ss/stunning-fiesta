**Trump Urges UK to Retain Control of Diego Garcia**

In a recent statement, US President Donald Trump has advised the United Kingdom against transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, which include the strategic military base Diego Garcia, to the Republic of Mauritius. The president framed the potential handover as an action that would negatively reflect on the UK. The British-administered archipelago has been the subject of a long-standing dispute, with Mauritius asserting its claim based on historical ties and a 2019 advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice. The large US military facility on Diego Garcia is considered a critical asset for operations in the Indian Ocean and Middle East. The UK Foreign Office has previously stated it will cede control of the territory to Mauritius when it is no longer required for defense purposes, but no timeline has been set.

Key points:
*   President Trump has publicly cautioned the UK against relinquishing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.
*   The US maintains a major military installation on Diego Garcia, central to its regional defense strategy.
*   Sovereignty of the islands is disputed, with Mauritius pursuing its claim through diplomatic and legal channels.
