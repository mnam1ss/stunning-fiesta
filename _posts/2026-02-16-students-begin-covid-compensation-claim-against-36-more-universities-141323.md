Students at 36 universities in the UK have initiated a group legal action seeking compensation for disruption to their education during the Covid-19 pandemic. The claim, organized by a student advocacy group, argues that prolonged campus closures, the shift to online learning, and reduced access to facilities constituted a breach of contract. This new wave of claims follows a recent, separate settlement between University College London and its students over similar issues related to lost in-person teaching and resources.

The law firm representing the students states that the cases focus on institutions that continued to charge full tuition fees despite not delivering the in-person academic experience and campus life that was advertised. The universities involved have not yet publicly commented on the new claims. The outcome of this legal action could have significant financial implications for the higher education sector.

Key points:
• A student group has filed compensation claims against 36 UK universities over pandemic-related educational disruption.
• The claims allege a breach of contract due to campus closures and the move to online instruction.
• The action follows a prior settlement by University College London with its students on similar grounds.
