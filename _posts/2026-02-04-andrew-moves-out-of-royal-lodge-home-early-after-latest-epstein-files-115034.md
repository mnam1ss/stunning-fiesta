The Duke of York has relocated from his long-term residence at Royal Lodge on the Windsor Estate. He is now residing at a temporary property on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. This move occurred earlier than had been previously indicated.

The relocation follows the recent public disclosure of court documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The documents have renewed public and media scrutiny of individuals connected to Epstein, including the Duke, who settled a civil sexual assault case in the United States in 2022. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

A representative for the Duke confirmed the move but did not provide further commentary on its timing. The Royal Lodge is expected to undergo renovations during his absence.

Key points:
- The Duke of York has moved to a temporary home on the Sandringham Estate.
- The relocation comes after the latest release of court files naming Jeffrey Epstein's associates.
- The Duke previously settled a civil case in the US and has denied allegations against him.
