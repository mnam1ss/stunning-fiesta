**Persistent Rainfall Prompts Widespread Flood Alerts Across England**

The UK Environment Agency has issued dozens of flood warnings and alerts across England following a prolonged period of rainfall. The Met Office confirmed that regions in south-west England and south Wales have experienced daily precipitation since the beginning of the year.

Authorities are advising residents in affected areas to remain vigilant. The sustained wet conditions have led to rising river levels and saturated ground, increasing the risk of flooding in several communities. Emergency services and local response teams are monitoring the situation closely and are prepared to act if conditions deteriorate.

The public is urged to check for local updates and follow official guidance regarding travel and property protection.

Key points:
*   Dozens of official flood warnings are currently active in England.
*   The Met Office reports daily rainfall has persisted in south-west England and south Wales since the start of 2026.
*   Emergency services are on alert due to heightened flood risks from saturated ground and high river levels.
