Students at several universities in Iran have held demonstrations, marking the first significant public anti-government protests since a widespread crackdown last month. The gatherings, reported at campuses in Tehran and other cities, were organized to commemorate those who died during the recent unrest. The earlier protests, sparked by the death of a young woman in morality police custody, had spread across the country before being suppressed by security forces.

The current student-led actions appear more contained but signal a persistence of dissent within academic institutions. Social media footage showed participants gathering in courtyards and chanting. Authorities have not released an official statement regarding the latest campus demonstrations. The protests occur amid ongoing international scrutiny of Iran's human rights record following the violent response to the previous wave of demonstrations.

Key points:
- Students at Iranian universities staged protests commemorating those killed in last month's crackdown.
- The demonstrations are the first notable anti-government actions since the suppression of nationwide unrest.
- The events have drawn renewed attention to domestic dissent and Iran's handling of protests.
