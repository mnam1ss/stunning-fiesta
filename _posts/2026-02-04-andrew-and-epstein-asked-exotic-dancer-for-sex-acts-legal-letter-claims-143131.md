A legal letter filed in a U.S. court alleges that Britain's Prince Andrew and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein solicited sexual acts from a woman in the early 2000s. According to attorneys for the unnamed woman, the incident occurred at Epstein's New York residence, where she was reportedly pressured into providing services and felt exploited. The document is part of ongoing civil litigation related to Epstein's activities.

Prince Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A settlement in a separate lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against the prince was reached in 2022. Representatives for the royal have not issued a new public statement regarding this latest claim.

Key points:
- A court filing alleges Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein solicited sexual acts from a woman at Epstein's home.
- The woman's lawyers state she felt coerced and exploited during the alleged incident.
- Prince Andrew has previously denied misconduct related to Epstein and settled a separate lawsuit in 2022.
