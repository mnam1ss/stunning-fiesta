**Parliament Approves Release of Mandelson Files Following Government Reversal**

The House of Commons has approved a motion to release official documents concerning the appointment of former minister Peter Mandelson as UK Ambassador to the United States. This decision follows a significant shift in the government's position, which had initially sought to keep a portion of the records confidential.

The Prime Minister's office reversed its stance after facing substantial criticism from opposition parties, particularly within the Labour Party. Labour MPs had argued that withholding the documents was inappropriate and lacked transparency regarding the 2008 diplomatic appointment. The government's change in position clears the way for the relevant historical files to be made public.

Key points:
*   Parliament has supported a motion to publish archival records related to Peter Mandelson's appointment as Ambassador to the US.
*   The government altered its plan to withhold some documents after sustained pressure from the Labour Party.
*   The files pertain to a diplomatic posting made over fifteen years ago and their release is now expected to proceed.
