Charlotte Cadden, a retired detective, has been selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for an upcoming parliamentary by-election. The announcement follows the party's local selection process in the constituency.

In her initial comments following the selection, Cadden outlined two primary areas of focus for her campaign. She stated an intention to advocate for a formal government-led investigation into organized child sexual exploitation groups, often referred to as grooming gangs. Additionally, she expressed a policy goal of eliminating the federal carbon pricing mechanism.

The by-election will present an early electoral test for the new Conservative leader and the party's direction. Cadden will compete against candidates from other major parties to win the seat.

Key points:
*   Retired detective Charlotte Cadden is the new Conservative by-election candidate.
*   She advocates for a government inquiry into grooming gangs and scrapping the carbon tax.
*   The contest is seen as a significant test for the Conservative Party under its new leadership.
