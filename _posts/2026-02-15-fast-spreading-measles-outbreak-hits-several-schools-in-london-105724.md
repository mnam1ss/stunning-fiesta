Health officials in London are responding to a measles outbreak that has affected multiple schools, with a number of children requiring hospital treatment. Authorities have described the outbreak as "fast-spreading" and are urging parents and guardians to verify the vaccination status of their children.

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can lead to serious complications, particularly in young children and those who are unvaccinated. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is leading the response, which includes contact tracing and providing guidance to affected educational institutions. Officials emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infection and curb further transmission.

Key points:
* A measles outbreak across several London schools has resulted in multiple child hospitalizations.
* Health officials are urging families to ensure children have received the MMR vaccine.
* The UKHSA is conducting contact tracing and managing the public health response.
