Annual inflation has eased to 3%, according to the latest official figures, marking a notable slowdown in the pace of price increases across the economy. The primary drivers for the decline were significant reductions in the cost of food and fuel for consumers. This downward trend in inflation is a key economic indicator watched closely by policymakers.

Analysts note that a sustained decrease in inflation increases the likelihood that the central bank will consider reducing its benchmark interest rate in the coming months. Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs for mortgages and business loans, which can stimulate economic activity. The current data suggests previous monetary policy measures to curb inflation are having their intended effect, though officials continue to monitor core price pressures.

Key points:
* The annual inflation rate has fallen to 3%.
* Reduced costs for food and fuel were major contributing factors.
* The slowdown may influence future decisions on interest rates.
