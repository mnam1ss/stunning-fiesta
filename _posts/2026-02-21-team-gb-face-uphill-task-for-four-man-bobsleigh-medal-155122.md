Team GB's four-man bobsleigh crew is positioned in seventh place after the first two runs at the Cortina Olympic venue, leaving them with a significant challenge to reach the podium. The competition will conclude with the final two runs scheduled for later today. The current standings place the British sled over half a second behind the leading German team, a considerable margin in a sport where races are often decided by hundredths of a second. The crew, piloted by Brad Hall, will need exceptional performances in the remaining heats to move into medal contention. Other teams currently ahead in the standings include strong contenders from Germany, Canada, and the Russian Olympic Committee.

Key points:
• The British four-man bobsleigh team is in seventh place at the halfway stage.
• The crew trails the leading German team by more than half a second.
• The final two runs of the event are set to take place later today.
