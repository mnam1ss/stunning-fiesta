A young Japanese macaque at the Ichikawa City Zoo in Japan has drawn significant online attention. The juvenile monkey, named Punch, was observed interacting with a soft toy provided by zookeepers. This occurred following his separation from his mother, a situation that can be stressful for young primates. The zoo staff introduced the plush item as an enrichment and comfort object.

Video footage of Punch holding and cuddling the toy circulated widely on social media platforms, leading to widespread public interest. The zoo has stated that such items are part of standard animal care practices to support the well-being of animals in human care, particularly when natural social structures are disrupted.
