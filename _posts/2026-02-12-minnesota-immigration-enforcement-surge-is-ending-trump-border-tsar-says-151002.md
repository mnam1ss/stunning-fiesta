**Federal Immigration Enforcement Operation in Minnesota Concludes**

A high-profile federal immigration enforcement initiative in Minnesota has officially ended, according to a former Trump administration border official. The operation, which focused on the Minneapolis area, was part of a broader national effort to increase arrests of individuals residing in the country without legal authorization.

The enforcement actions, which involved coordination between multiple federal agencies, have been a subject of local debate. During the course of the operation, two individuals who were US citizens died in Minneapolis. The circumstances surrounding their deaths, including any potential connection to the enforcement activities, remain under review by local authorities.

The conclusion of the operation marks a shift in federal immigration enforcement priorities in the region, though officials have not detailed what subsequent policies may be implemented.

Key points:
*   A former senior border official confirmed the end of a federal immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.
*   The operation, centered on Minneapolis, resulted in the deaths of two US citizens, with investigations ongoing.
*   The termination signals a change in enforcement strategy for the area.
