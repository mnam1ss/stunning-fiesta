**Government May Postpone Youth Wage Increase**

Government officials are reportedly considering a delay to a planned policy that would equalize the minimum wage across all age groups, according to sources speaking to the BBC. The proposal, which aims to end lower pay rates for younger workers, could now be implemented on a slower timeline than initially anticipated.

The current system in the UK sets different minimum wage levels based on a worker's age, with those under 23 receiving lower hourly rates. The policy under discussion would remove these age brackets, granting workers aged 21 and over the same national living wage. While the government has previously signaled support for the change, internal discussions now suggest a more gradual approach may be adopted. No official announcement has been made regarding the revised schedule.

Key points:
*   Sources indicate a potential slowdown in plans to unify the minimum wage for different age groups.
*   The policy would eliminate lower pay rates for younger workers, aligning them with the national living wage.
*   An official decision on the implementation timeline from the government is still pending.
