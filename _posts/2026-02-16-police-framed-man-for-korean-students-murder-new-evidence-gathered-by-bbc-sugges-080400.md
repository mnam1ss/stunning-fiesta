**New Evidence Questions Murder Conviction in 2002 Bournemouth Case**

A BBC Panorama investigation has uncovered evidence suggesting a man was wrongfully convicted for a murder in Bournemouth over two decades ago. Omar Benguit was found guilty of killing a South Korean student, Joon Oh, in 2002 and has served more than 20 years in prison. The new report indicates that police were aware of closed-circuit television footage which contradicted the testimony of their primary witness. According to the investigation, this footage was not disclosed to the defense at the time of the trial.

The BBC’s findings have prompted calls for a review of the case. Benguit has consistently maintained his innocence. The Crown Prosecution Service and relevant police authorities have stated they are examining the new information presented by the documentary.

**Key points:**
*   Omar Benguit was convicted in 2005 for a 2002 murder in Bournemouth.
*   A BBC investigation alleges police withheld CCTV evidence that discredited a key witness.
*   The findings have led to renewed scrutiny and requests for a case review.
