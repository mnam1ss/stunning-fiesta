Japan's governing coalition is projected to secure a majority in a snap election for the lower house of parliament, according to national media exit polls. The alliance, led by Prime Minister Takaichi, appears to have won a decisive number of seats, reinforcing its control of the legislature.

Official results are expected to be confirmed in the coming hours as vote counting continues.

Key points:
