Ukrainian naval divers are currently conducting operations to locate and neutralize Russian naval mines in the Black Sea. The work, occurring in areas still under Ukrainian control, is described as a slow and perilous process due to the sensitive and volatile nature of the ordnance.

The divers systematically search designated zones, often in conditions of limited visibility. When a mine is located, specialists must assess the safest method for its disposal, which sometimes involves controlled detonation. The presence of these explosive devices poses a continuous threat to maritime safety and commercial shipping routes in the region.

Key points:
- Ukrainian divers are clearing Russian naval mines from controlled areas of the Black Sea.
- The disposal process is hazardous and requires meticulous handling of unstable explosives.
- The operations aim to mitigate risks to civilian maritime traffic and secure coastal waters.
