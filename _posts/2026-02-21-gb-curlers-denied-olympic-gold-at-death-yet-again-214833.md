British men's curling team falls short of Olympic gold in final

The British men's curling team, skipped by Bruce Mouat, has been defeated in the gold medal match at the Winter Olympics. The team lost to Canada, ending its bid for a first men's Olympic curling title in over a century. This result also marks a second consecutive Olympic final loss for Mouat's rink, which was also the runner-up at the previous Winter Games. The silver medal brings Team GB's total gold medal count at these Games to three, as the curling squad was unable to secure a fourth. The victory extends Canada's successful record in Olympic men's curling.

Key points:
*   Team GB, led by skip Bruce Mouat, lost the men's curling final to Canada.
*   The result extends Britain's wait for a men's Olympic curling gold beyond 100 years.
*   It is the second straight Olympic silver medal for Mouat's rink after also finishing second in 2022.
