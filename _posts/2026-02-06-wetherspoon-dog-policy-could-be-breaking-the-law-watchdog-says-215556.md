The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has contacted the national pub chain JD Wetherspoon regarding its policy on assistance dogs. The intervention follows complaints from customers with disabilities who have reportedly faced challenges when visiting the company's establishments with their service animals.

The EHRC, Britain's national equality body, is examining whether the current practices comply with legal obligations under the Equality Act 2010. This legislation requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, which typically includes allowing entry to assistance dogs. The watchdog's correspondence with the chain signals a formal review of the situation.

Wetherspoon has stated it welcomes all assistance dogs in its pubs and is reviewing its guidance to staff to ensure clarity and compliance. The outcome of the EHRC's engagement could influence policies across the hospitality sector.

Key points:
*   The equality watchdog is reviewing Wetherspoon's assistance dog policy after customer complaints.
*   The investigation concerns potential breaches of the Equality Act 2010.
*   The pub chain says it permits assistance dogs and is updating staff guidance.
