Newly released emails from the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s network reveal details about his financial interactions with Britain’s Prince Andrew. The correspondence indicates the Duke of York encouraged Epstein to engage in business with David Rowland, a British businessman previously described in media reports as a "shady financier." According to the messages, Prince Andrew viewed Rowland as a trusted financial advisor.

However, the emails suggest Epstein expressed hesitation about entering into a financial arrangement with Rowland. The nature of the proposed business and the specific reasons for Epstein’s wariness are not detailed in the disclosed correspondence. The documents are part of a wider trove being examined following court-ordered releases related to Epstein’s associates.

Key points:
• Emails show Prince Andrew advocated for Jeffrey Epstein to work with businessman David Rowland.
• Epstein appeared reluctant to pursue the suggested financial partnership.
• The correspondence forms part of ongoing disclosures from the Epstein case files.
