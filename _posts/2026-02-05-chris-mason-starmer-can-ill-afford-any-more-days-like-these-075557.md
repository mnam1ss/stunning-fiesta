Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly facing internal discontent following a series of political setbacks, according to a BBC analysis. The report indicates significant tension between Starmer and senior party figure Lord Peter Mandelson, with the leader said to be angered by recent developments. The mood within the parliamentary Labour Party is described as increasingly pessimistic as it contends with ongoing challenges.

These internal strains emerge during a critical period for the opposition party, which is seeking to maintain a consistent public message and political momentum. Observers note that further days marked by internal discord and negative headlines could prove damaging to Labour's standing. The situation highlights the pressures of managing a broad coalition within the party ahead of the next national election.

Key points:
• Internal tensions are rising within the Labour Party, including between Sir Keir Starmer and Lord Mandelson.
• The mood among Labour MPs is reportedly darkening following recent political difficulties.
• Analysts suggest the party can ill afford prolonged periods of internal strife and negative publicity.
