**Police Warn of Increase in High-Tech Vehicle Theft**

Law enforcement agencies are reporting a significant rise in keyless vehicle thefts, indicating a shift toward more organized and technologically advanced methods by criminals. This trend involves thieves exploiting electronic systems to gain access to and start vehicles without the original key fob. Authorities note that these operations are often sophisticated, targeting a wide range of modern car models equipped with keyless entry and ignition systems.

Security experts advise vehicle owners to take additional precautions. Recommendations include using physical steering wheel locks, storing key fobs in signal-blocking pouches, and ensuring vehicles are parked in well-lit or secure areas when possible. The increase in such incidents highlights the ongoing challenge of adapting security measures to counter evolving criminal techniques.

Key points:
*   Reports indicate a surge in thefts utilizing keyless entry system vulnerabilities.
*   Criminal operations are described as increasingly organized and employing advanced technology.
*   Security professionals recommend supplementary physical and electronic deterrents for vehicle owners.
