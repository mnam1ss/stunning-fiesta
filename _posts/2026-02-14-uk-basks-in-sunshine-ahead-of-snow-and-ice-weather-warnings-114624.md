The United Kingdom is experiencing a brief period of clear, cold weather this weekend following a spell of unsettled conditions. This sunny interlude is expected to be short-lived, however, as forecasters warn of incoming snow and ice. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for these hazards, indicating potential travel disruption and hazardous conditions in affected areas.

Meteorologists note that the current high-pressure system bringing sunshine will be replaced by a colder air mass. This shift is likely to bring wintry showers, particularly to northern and eastern regions, with ice forming on untreated surfaces. Residents are advised to stay updated on the latest forecasts and exercise caution.

Key points:
* A sunny but cold weekend precedes forecasted snow and ice.
* The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for potential travel disruption.
* The public is advised to monitor forecasts and take care on icy surfaces.
