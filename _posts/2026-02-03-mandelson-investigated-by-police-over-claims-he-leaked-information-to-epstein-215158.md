Police in the United Kingdom are investigating claims that former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson leaked sensitive government information to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The inquiry follows allegations that Mandelson, who served under Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, passed confidential details during Epstein's lifetime.

Authorities have confirmed they are assessing the information to determine if any criminal offenses occurred. The investigation is in its preliminary stages, and no formal charges have been filed. Mandelson, through a representative, has previously denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The probe revisits connections between British political figures and the convicted sex offender, which have been scrutinized in recent years.

Key points:
* UK police are investigating Peter Mandelson over allegations he leaked government information to Jeffrey Epstein.
* The former minister has denied any misconduct related to the late financier.
* The investigation is currently preliminary, with no charges yet brought.
