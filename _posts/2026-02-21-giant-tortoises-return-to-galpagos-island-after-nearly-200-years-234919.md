**Giant Tortoises Reintroduced to Galápagos Island Following Extinction**

A group of 158 young giant tortoises has been released onto a Galápagos island, marking the return of a native species absent for nearly two centuries. The tortoises were historically eradicated from the island by whalers and other sailors during the 1800s.

The reintroduction effort is a collaborative conservation project led by Galápagos National Park and international scientific partners. The juvenile tortoises, which are a hybrid species bred from genetically similar tortoises, were transported to the island and released into its highlands. Conservationists state the animals are intended to fulfill the crucial ecological role of their extinct predecessors, such as seed dispersal and vegetation management.

Officials will monitor the tortoises, which are equipped with microchips, to track their adaptation and movement. The long-term goal is to establish a stable, breeding population to restore the island's natural ecosystem balance.

Key points:
- 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to a Galápagos island where they went extinct in the 1800s.
- The tortoises are a hybrid breed selected to perform the ecological functions of the original extinct population.
- The project aims to restore the island's ecosystem through natural processes like seed dispersal.
