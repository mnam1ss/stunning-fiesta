A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of a five-year-old child who had been held in immigration detention in Minneapolis. The case involved Liam Conejo Ramos, whose detention while wearing a Spider-Man backpack drew significant public attention and protest from advocacy groups.

The child was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials earlier this month. The circumstances leading to the detention have not been fully detailed by authorities. The judge’s ruling mandates that the boy be released to a family member or designated sponsor. Legal representatives for the child argued that his detention was inappropriate and not in accordance with policies regarding minors.

The decision follows a series of legal filings and a growing number of public calls for his release, highlighting ongoing debates over immigration enforcement practices involving young children.

Key points:
- A federal judge has mandated the release of a five-year-old boy from ICE detention in Minneapolis.
- The child’s detention had prompted national criticism and legal challenges from advocates.
- The ruling requires the boy to be placed with a family member or approved sponsor.
