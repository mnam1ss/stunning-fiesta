Two infant deaths at a hospital trust in southern England have raised serious concerns about maternity care standards. The incidents occurred under the care of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust.

The families of two babies, whose mothers are named as Beth and Sophie, have spoken out about their experiences following the losses. Their cases have been highlighted as part of ongoing scrutiny into maternity services at the trust.

A recent independent review of maternity services at the trust identified significant areas requiring improvement. Health regulators are monitoring the situation as the trust implements changes to its procedures and training.

**Key points:**
*   Two infant deaths have prompted scrutiny of maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust.
*   An independent review has found serious failings and required the trust to enact an improvement plan.
*   The cases have been made public by the families involved amid wider national attention on maternity safety.
