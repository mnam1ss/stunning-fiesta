Newly disclosed documents indicate that the Duke of York, while serving as a UK trade envoy, shared confidential information with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The role of a trade envoy typically requires the safeguarding of sensitive commercial and political intelligence. The files suggest this duty may have been breached during Prince Andrew's tenure in the position.

The allegations stem from a review of documents, including a memo from 2011, which is part of a wider collection of evidence. The Duke has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender. Buckingham Palace has previously stated it would not comment on ongoing legal matters.

Key points:
- Documents suggest a breach of confidentiality by Prince Andrew in his former role.
- The duty of a trade envoy includes protecting sensitive commercial and political information.
- The Duke has previously denied any wrongdoing regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein.
