A parliamentary committee is set to examine the framework for appointing and overseeing trade envoys, following the recent arrest of a former envoy. The cross-party group will review the selection process and the mechanisms for holding individuals in these roles accountable.

The discussion comes after former Conservative MP Andrew was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He had previously served as a trade envoy. The committee's planned inquiry is not a direct investigation into that specific case, but will consider the broader system in light of recent events.

The role of trade envoys, typically MPs appointed to promote UK business interests with specific countries, has come under increased scrutiny. The committee aims to assess whether current procedures are sufficiently robust.

Key points:
- A parliamentary committee will review the appointment and accountability of UK trade envoys.
- The review follows the arrest of a former envoy, though it is not an investigation into that individual case.
- The inquiry will assess the overall system governing these unpaid, advisory roles.
