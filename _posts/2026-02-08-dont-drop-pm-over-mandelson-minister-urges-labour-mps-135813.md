A senior Labour figure has cautioned party members against any attempt to remove the Prime Minister following the recent appointment of Peter Mandelson to a key advisory role. Pat McFadden, a cabinet minister, acknowledged that the decision to bring Lord Mandelson into the government had been controversial and a misstep. However, he argued that forcing a leadership change now would create significant political instability.

McFadden emphasized that the current focus should remain on governing and addressing national issues, rather than internal party disputes. His comments come amid reported discontent within Labour ranks over the strategic direction and personnel choices of the leadership.

Key points:
• A cabinet minister has publicly defended the Prime Minister amid internal party criticism.
• The defence follows discontent over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as a senior adviser.
• The minister warned that attempting to oust the leader would destabilize the government.
