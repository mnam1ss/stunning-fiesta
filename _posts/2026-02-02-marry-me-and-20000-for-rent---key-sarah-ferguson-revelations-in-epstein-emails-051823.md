Newly released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein case contain references to Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, according to a BBC report. The correspondence, which includes emails, reportedly shows Epstein offering to cover a £20,000 rental payment for the Duchess. In a separate email, Epstein is said to have written "marry me" to Ferguson.

The documents are part of a wider trove of court records being made public from a lawsuit related to the late financier. The reported communications are expected to renew scrutiny of Ferguson's past association with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A spokesperson for the Duchess has previously stated she regrets her connection with Epstein.

Key points:
*   Emails reportedly show Epstein offering to pay a £20,000 rent bill for Sarah Ferguson.
*   Another email from Epstein to the Duchess is said to contain the phrase "marry me."
*   The disclosures are likely to refocus attention on Ferguson's past links to the financier.
