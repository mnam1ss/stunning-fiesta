A new release of documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein has been made public, comprising approximately three million pages. The records, unsealed by a U.S. court, stem from a settled civil lawsuit and are part of an ongoing effort to provide transparency into Epstein’s network.

The documents contain numerous references to prominent individuals, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose name appears hundreds of times. The files also include email correspondence between Epstein and an individual identified as "The Duke." The identities and relationships of many individuals mentioned in the records are a primary focus of public and media scrutiny.

The release is expected to fuel further analysis of Epstein’s associations, though the legal proceedings against him concluded with his death in 2019.

Key points:
*   The document release totals around three million pages from a prior civil case.
*   Records contain frequent mentions of Donald Trump and emails to a contact called "The Duke."
*   The disclosures aim to provide transparency into Epstein's circle of associates.
