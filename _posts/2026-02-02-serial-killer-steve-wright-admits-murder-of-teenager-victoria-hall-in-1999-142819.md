**Convicted Serial Killer Admits to 1999 Murder**

Steve Wright, a man currently serving a life sentence for the murders of five women in 2006, has now admitted to the killing of teenager Victoria Hall in 1999. The Suffolk Police confirmed the development, stating Wright’s admission provides long-sought answers in a case that remained unsolved for over two decades.

Victoria Hall, 17, disappeared after a night out in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Her body was discovered days later in a remote ditch. The case had been one of the UK's most high-profile unsolved murders. Police had previously linked Wright to the crime through DNA evidence recovered from the scene.

Wright is already imprisoned under a whole life order, meaning he will never be released. Authorities have indicated that no further court proceedings are expected following this confession.

Key points:
*   Steve Wright confessed to the 1999 murder of 17-year-old Victoria Hall.
*   He is already serving a whole life sentence for five other murders committed in 2006.
*   The confession resolves a major cold case investigated by Suffolk Police for over 20 years.
