The Trump administration is reducing the number of federal law enforcement officers deployed in Minnesota, according to an official. Approximately 700 personnel are being withdrawn from the operation.

Tom Homan, the federal official overseeing the deployment, stated that around 2,000 officers will remain in the state. He also confirmed a separate initiative to provide more federal officers with body-worn cameras, though he did not specify which agencies or units would receive the equipment. The officers have been deployed in recent months to assist local authorities.

The drawdown comes amid ongoing discussions about the federal role in supporting local law enforcement in various U.S. cities.

Key points:
- About 700 federal agents are being pulled back from Minnesota.
- An estimated 2,000 personnel will stay, according to official Tom Homan.
- The federal government is expanding the use of body cameras for its officers.
