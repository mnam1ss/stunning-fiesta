The Foreign Office has initiated a review into the severance payment made to Lord Peter Mandelson following the termination of his appointment as the UK's ambassador to the United States, according to internal sources. The review will examine the circumstances and justification for the financial settlement. Lord Mandelson, a former Labour cabinet minister, was appointed to the Washington role in late 2023 but was removed from the position earlier this year by the current government. Officials have confirmed the process is underway but have not provided a specific timeline for its completion or detailed the criteria being assessed. The move follows standard procedure for examining significant expenditures after a change in administration.

Key points:
- The Foreign Office is reviewing the severance payment given to Lord Mandelson after his dismissal as US ambassador.
- Lord Mandelson was appointed to the role in 2023 and removed from it earlier this year.
- Officials state the review is a standard procedure but have not outlined a completion date.
