Former President Donald Trump announced a revision to his proposed trade policy on Saturday, stating he would raise a new set of global tariffs to 15%. This announcement follows a recent legal decision that invalidated the majority of his previously established tariff measures. Trump initially introduced the new tariffs at a rate of 10% before deciding to increase them further.

The policy shift comes amid ongoing debates over international trade strategy and its economic impacts. Specific details regarding which countries or goods would be affected by the increased tariff rate were not immediately clarified in the announcement. The proposal would require formal implementation through legislative or executive processes should Trump return to office.

Key points:
*   Donald Trump has stated he will increase a proposed new global tariff rate to 15%, revising an initial 10% plan.
*   The announcement follows a recent legal ruling that struck down most of his earlier tariff policies.
*   The revised tariff proposal would need to be enacted through official governmental channels to take effect.
