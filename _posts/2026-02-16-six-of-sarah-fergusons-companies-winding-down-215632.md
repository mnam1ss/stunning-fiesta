Six companies associated with Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, have begun the process of winding down their operations. This administrative action follows renewed public attention regarding her past association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

The companies, which are registered at the same London address, include a firm bearing her title. Official records indicate that dissolution procedures for these entities were initiated earlier this month. A spokesperson for the Duchess stated that this was a standard administrative update following a review of commercial operations, and that she remains focused on her charitable work and literary projects.

The development occurs amidst continued media scrutiny of social connections to Epstein, though there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the Duchess in relation to these corporate matters.

Key points:
• Six companies linked to the Duchess of York are being dissolved.
• The action follows renewed focus on her past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
• A spokesperson described the move as a routine administrative update.
