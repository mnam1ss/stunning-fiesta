BBC Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet has reported from Tehran for the first time since a major government crackdown on protests last month. Her reporting indicates that while official rallies marking the anniversary of Iran's 1979 revolution proceeded, they were accompanied by visible public discontent and defiance.

Official ceremonies commemorating the revolution's anniversary were held across the country. In the capital, however, Doucet observed a subdued atmosphere in many areas, with some citizens expressing frustration over economic conditions and social restrictions. The visit comes weeks after security forces moved decisively to quell widespread demonstrations, an event that has left a palpable tension.

The report describes a complex scene where state-organized displays of loyalty coexist with quieter, but persistent, signs of public dissatisfaction.

Key points:
• A BBC correspondent has returned to Tehran following a significant government response to protests.
• Official revolution anniversary events were held, but reports note underlying public frustration.
• The atmosphere remains tense following last month's security crackdown.
