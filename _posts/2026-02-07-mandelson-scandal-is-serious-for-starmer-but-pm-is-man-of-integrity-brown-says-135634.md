Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has commented on the ongoing controversy surrounding Labour Party figures and the conduct of Sir Keir Starmer. Mr. Brown stated that the situation presents a significant challenge for the Labour leader, suggesting his response may not have been swift enough. However, Mr. Brown also expressed confidence in Sir Keir's ability to address the issues and implement necessary reforms within the party. In his remarks, Mr. Brown characterized current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a person of integrity.
