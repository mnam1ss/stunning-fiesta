**Supreme Court Ruling on Tariffs Creates Trade Policy Uncertainty**

A recent Supreme Court decision has struck down a portion of former President Donald Trump's tariff policies, creating new questions for international trade. The ruling specifically invalidated certain broad-based import taxes that had been applied globally. In response to this judicial action, Trump has announced the implementation of a new, across-the-board 10% tariff on imports.

Legal experts indicate the Court's decision limits the executive branch's authority to levy tariffs unilaterally under the specific laws cited by the previous administration. The introduction of the new 10% tariff proposal, which would require congressional approval, signals a continued focus on protectionist trade measures as a central policy theme. Analysts suggest these developments add a layer of uncertainty for businesses engaged in global supply chains, which must now navigate a shifting regulatory landscape.

Key points:
*   The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected certain global tariffs enacted during the Trump administration.
*   In reaction, Trump has proposed a new universal 10% tariff on imports.
*   The legal and policy shifts are expected to increase uncertainty in global trade relations.
