**US Government Enters Partial Shutdown as Funding Lapses**

The United States federal government entered a partial shutdown early Saturday after Congress failed to pass a set of spending bills before a midnight deadline. This lapse affects a range of non-essential services and federal employees.

A bipartisan agreement on a temporary funding package was reached by Senate leaders late Friday. However, procedural rules in the House of Representatives prevented an immediate vote. The House is now scheduled to reconvene, with the earliest possible vote to approve the deal and restore funding occurring on Monday.

The shutdown impacts various agencies whose annual appropriations have not been enacted. Operations deemed essential, such as national security and air traffic control, continue.

**Key points:**
*   A partial US government shutdown began due to a missed funding deadline.
*   A stopgap funding deal exists but cannot be voted on until the House returns Monday.
*   Essential services continue, but many federal operations are paused.
