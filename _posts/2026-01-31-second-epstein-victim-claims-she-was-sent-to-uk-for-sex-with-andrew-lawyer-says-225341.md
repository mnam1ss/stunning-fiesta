A second woman has come forward with allegations against the Duke of York, according to her legal representative. The claimant, who was in her twenties at the time, states she was directed to travel to the United Kingdom in 2010 for a sexual encounter with Prince Andrew. The alleged incident is said to have taken place at Royal Lodge, the Duke's residence in Windsor.

These new claims emerge from a civil lawsuit filed in the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. The woman's lawyer asserts she was a victim of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and was trafficked for this purpose. Buckingham Palace has previously and consistently denied all allegations of wrongdoing by the Duke of York in relation to Jeffrey Epstein.

Key points:
• A second accuser alleges she was sent to the UK for a sexual encounter with Prince Andrew in 2010.
• The claim, made by the woman's attorney, is part of a civil case against Ghislaine Maxwell in the US.
• The Duke of York has repeatedly denied all allegations related to his association with Jeffrey Epstein.
