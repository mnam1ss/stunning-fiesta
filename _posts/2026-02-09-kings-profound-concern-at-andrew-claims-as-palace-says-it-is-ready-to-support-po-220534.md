King Charles III has publicly addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding his brother, Prince Andrew, for the first time, expressing serious concern over the allegations. A statement from Buckingham Palace indicated that the monarch is prepared to cooperate with law enforcement should they request assistance in their investigations. The development follows renewed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

The Palace's announcement marks a significant shift in the royal family's public handling of the long-running scandal. While no new police inquiry has been announced, the statement clarifies the institution's official position regarding potential future cooperation. Prince Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing and previously settled a civil sexual assault case in the United States out of court.

Key points:
- King Charles has expressed deep concern over allegations linked to his brother, Prince Andrew.
- Buckingham Palace states it is prepared to support any relevant police inquiries.
- This is the King's first direct public comment on matters related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
