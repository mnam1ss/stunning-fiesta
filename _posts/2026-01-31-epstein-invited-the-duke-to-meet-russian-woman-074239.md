A newly released set of documents from the US Department of Justice includes an email exchange in which the late financier Jeffrey Epstein extended an invitation to a person referred to as "The Duke." The invitation was for this individual to meet a Russian woman. This disclosure is part of a broader ongoing release of materials related to Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The documents are being made public following court orders in a settled civil case. The identities and specific context of the individuals mentioned in this particular email are not fully detailed in the initial reporting.

Key points:
*   Newly unsealed court documents contain an email from Jeffrey Epstein inviting "The Duke" to meet a Russian woman.
*   The release is part of a wider document disclosure mandated by a US court.
*   The documents stem from litigation connected to Epstein, who faced sex trafficking charges prior to his death.
