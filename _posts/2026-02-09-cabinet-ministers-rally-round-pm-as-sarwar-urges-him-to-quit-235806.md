Cabinet ministers have publicly expressed their support for the Prime Minister following renewed calls for his resignation from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. The political pressure comes amid ongoing scrutiny of the government's performance.

Mr. Sarwar stated that the conduct and standards emanating from the Prime Minister's office have fallen short of public expectations. Despite this criticism, the Prime Minister has firmly rejected the suggestion that he should step down, with several senior government figures reiterating their confidence in his leadership.

The public disagreement highlights continuing tensions within the UK's political landscape as differing parties assess the government's record. The Prime Minister's office has not indicated any change in position regarding his tenure.

Key points:
• The Scottish Labour leader has called for the Prime Minister to resign, citing insufficient standards.
• The Prime Minister has refused to resign and is receiving backing from members of his cabinet.
• The dispute underscores ongoing political divisions over the government's performance.
