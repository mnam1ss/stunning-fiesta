Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for a significant shift in U.S. policy toward Iran, with the goal of destabilizing the current Iranian government, according to regional analysts. The strategy is said to depend on the potential re-election of former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration might pursue more aggressive actions. Observers suggest the Israeli leadership is encouraging Washington to consider extensive military strikes against Iranian targets, moving beyond previous containment strategies.

This reported push aligns with longstanding tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly over Iran's nuclear program and regional activities. The outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election is viewed as a critical factor for any major change in this foreign policy approach. Officials from the involved nations have not publicly confirmed these specific strategic discussions.

Key points:
*   Israeli officials are allegedly urging the U.S. to adopt a more forceful stance aimed at the Iranian leadership.
*   The potential return of former President Trump to office is seen as pivotal to this strategy.
*   The policy would mark a departure from previous efforts focused on deterrence and diplomacy.
