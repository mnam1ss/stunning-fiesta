Newly released emails indicate that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, sought financial advice from Jeffrey Epstein while he was incarcerated, according to a BBC report. The correspondence reportedly shows Ferguson contacting the convicted sex offender in 2010, during his jail term for soliciting a minor for prostitution, to discuss her personal bankruptcy situation. The emails suggest she was exploring various options to address her financial difficulties at the time.

A representative for the Duchess has not publicly commented on the specific email exchange. The documents are part of a broader release of materials related to Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Key points:
*   Emails show Sarah Ferguson contacted Jeffrey Epstein about her finances in 2010.
*   The contact occurred while Epstein was serving a jail sentence for solicitation.
*   The correspondence relates to her personal bankruptcy proceedings during that period.
