Green Party leader Adrian Polanski has called for a significant shift in how England and Wales address drug use, advocating for a move away from criminalization. Speaking publicly, Polanski emphasized the need for a "public health approach" to the issue, framing substance use primarily as a health matter rather than a criminal one. He reiterated his party's support for the legalisation and regulation of currently illicit drugs.

Polanski argued that the existing punitive framework has failed to reduce harm or usage rates, suggesting that a regulated system could improve safety and allow for better support services. His comments align with long-standing Green Party policy, which views decriminalization as a step toward reducing drug-related deaths and undermining criminal enterprises. The proposal is likely to reignite debate on drug law reform, a topic that remains politically divisive in the UK.

Key points:
- Green Party leader Adrian Polanski advocates replacing criminal penalties with a public health strategy for drugs.
- He reiterated support for legalising and regulating illicit substances to improve safety and support.
- The call is expected to renew political debate on drug policy reform in England and Wales.
