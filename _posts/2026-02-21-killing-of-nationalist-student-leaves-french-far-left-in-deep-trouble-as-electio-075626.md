French political tensions have escalated following the death of a student, with the country's far-left movement facing significant criticism in the run-up to parliamentary elections. The victim, identified as Quentin Deranque, was a member of a nationalist student group. Authorities are investigating the incident, with early suspicions pointing toward individuals linked to far-left militant circles.

The incident has prompted widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with much of the focus falling on La France Insoumise (LFI), the party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Political opponents have accused LFI of fostering a climate of hostility. The party has denounced the violence and any involvement by its supporters, but the allegations are dominating political discourse as campaigning intensifies.

Key points:
*   A student's death has intensified political friction ahead of the French legislative elections.
*   The far-left La France Insoumise party faces broad condemnation, though it denies involvement.
*   Authorities are investigating suspected links to far-left militants in the case.
