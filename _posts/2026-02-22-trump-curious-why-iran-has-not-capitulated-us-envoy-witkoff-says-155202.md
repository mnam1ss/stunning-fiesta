US President Donald Trump has expressed confusion over Iran's continued resistance to American pressure, according to a senior US envoy. Special Representative Steve Witkoff stated that the president is questioning why Iran has not yielded following a significant increase in US military assets deployed to the region. The remarks come amid ongoing tensions between Washington and Tehran, which have escalated over the past year.

The US has recently bolstered its military presence in the Middle East, including the deployment of additional troops and advanced military equipment. The administration's stated strategy has been one of applying "maximum pressure" on Iran through economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Iranian officials have consistently rejected calls for new negotiations under the current conditions, maintaining that the US must first return to the 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions.

Key points:
*   A US envoy says President Trump is puzzled by Iran's refusal to back down.
*   The comments follow a notable US military build-up in the Middle East.
*   Iran has so far rejected negotiations, demanding sanctions relief first.
