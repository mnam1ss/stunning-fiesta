**Cabinet Secretary Candidate Subject of Multiple Conduct Complaints**

A leading candidate for the UK's top civil service role has faced several allegations of bullying, according to new reports. Antonia Romeo, currently the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Justice, is considered a frontrunner to become the next Cabinet Secretary.

These reports contradict an earlier statement from the Cabinet Office, which had stated that only one formal complaint regarding Romeo's conduct had been made and subsequently dismissed following an internal inquiry. The nature and number of the additional alleged complaints have not been officially detailed.

The Cabinet Office has declined to comment on the new claims. The process for appointing the new Cabinet Secretary, who oversees the entire civil service, is ongoing.

Key points:
*   Reports indicate multiple bullying complaints have been made against Antonia Romeo.
*   This conflicts with an official statement citing only one dismissed complaint.
*   The Cabinet Office has not commented on the new allegations.
