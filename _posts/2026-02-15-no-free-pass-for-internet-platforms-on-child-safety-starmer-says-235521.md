The UK government has launched a public consultation on new online safety measures, with a focus on protecting children. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that digital platforms will not receive exemptions from their responsibilities regarding child protection. Among the proposals under consideration is a potential prohibition on social media access for individuals under the age of 16.

The consultation seeks input from the public, tech companies, and child safety experts to shape future legislation. Officials aim to balance safety concerns with issues of privacy and digital access for young people. This move follows ongoing debates about the impact of social media on youth mental health and development.

Key points:
*   The government is seeking public views on enhanced online safety rules.
*   A possible ban on social media for under-16s is a central proposal.
*   Prime Minister Starmer emphasized that internet companies must prioritize child safety.
