Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych has been prohibited from wearing his competition helmet at international events. The helmet features images of Ukrainian athletes who have died since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) ruled the design violates regulations prohibiting political statements on equipment.

Heraskevych, who gained attention for displaying an anti-war message on a sign at the Beijing 2022 Olympics, had the helmet custom-painted to honor fallen peers from various sports. The federation stated its decision was based on maintaining neutrality and ensuring the sport remains free from political demonstrations. Heraskevych and Ukrainian sports officials have expressed disappointment with the ban, viewing the helmet as a personal tribute rather than a political act.

Key points:
- A Ukrainian slider's helmet depicting deceased athletes has been banned for violating neutrality rules.
- The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation enforces policies against political statements on gear.
- The athlete intended the design as a tribute to fellow sports figures killed during the ongoing conflict.
