A second round of direct negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded on Thursday after a brief session. The talks, aimed at finding a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict, lasted approximately two hours. Officials from both sides have described the discussions as difficult, with no immediate agreement reached.

The meeting was held in an undisclosed location, following an initial round earlier in the week. While the dialogue continues, military engagements across Ukraine have intensified. Both parties have agreed to pursue a third round of talks in the near future, though a specific date has not been announced. The lack of a breakthrough underscores the significant challenges in bridging the positions of the two nations.

Key points:
- A second day of peace talks ended after about two hours with no agreement.
- Delegations from both Ukraine and Russia characterized the discussions as challenging.
- Plans for a third round of negotiations were confirmed, despite the ongoing conflict.
