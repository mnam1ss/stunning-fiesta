US politicians have called for Lord Peter Mandelson, a former British cabinet minister, to provide testimony regarding his past connections to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The request comes as part of ongoing investigations into Epstein’s network. Mandelson has publicly acknowledged in the past that maintaining a friendship with Epstein was an error in judgment. The appeal from US lawmakers highlights the continued international interest in securing information from individuals who had associations with Epstein, who was facing sex trafficking charges before his death in 2019. There has been no immediate public response from Lord Mandelson or his representatives to the latest request for his cooperation.

Key points:
• US legislators are seeking testimony from former UK minister Lord Mandelson concerning Jeffrey Epstein.
• Mandelson has previously stated he regrets his past association with the financier.
• The request underscores the wider, ongoing inquiries into Epstein’s contacts following his 2019 death.
