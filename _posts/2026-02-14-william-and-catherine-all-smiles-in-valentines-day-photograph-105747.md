A previously unreleased photograph of the Prince and Princess of Wales was shared publicly on Valentine's Day. The image, which shows the couple smiling, was accompanied by a brief message wishing the public a happy Valentine's Day and included a heart symbol. The official social media account for the couple distributed the picture, which has since been widely circulated by news outlets.

The release follows a period of limited public appearances by Catherine as she recovers from a planned abdominal surgery performed in January. Official communications have stated her recovery is progressing well and that she is not expected to return to public duties until after Easter. The Valentine's Day photograph marks one of the few new images of the couple released since her hospitalization.

Key points:
* A new photograph of the Prince and Princess of Wales was released for Valentine's Day.
* The image was shared alongside a holiday greeting on their official social media.
* It comes during the Princess's recovery from surgery, with a return to duties expected after Easter.
