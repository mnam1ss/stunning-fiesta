A clinical trial investigating the use of puberty blockers for adolescents in the UK has been temporarily halted following a review by the national medicines regulator. The pause was initiated to allow for a reassessment of the trial's protocols, specifically regarding the age of participants.

The regulatory body has advised that the minimum age for enrollment in the study should be increased. This recommendation is based on a standard review of safety and ethical considerations for clinical research involving minors. The trial's organizers are now evaluating this guidance to determine the next steps for the research program.

The study aims to build a more robust evidence base regarding the effects and outcomes of these medications for young people experiencing gender dysphoria. Further updates on the trial's status are expected after the review is complete.

Key points:
- A UK puberty blockers trial has been paused on the advice of the medicines regulator.
- The regulator recommends raising the minimum age for participants in the study.
- Trial organizers are reviewing the guidance to decide on the future of the research.
