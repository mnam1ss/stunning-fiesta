**Major Artists Shift from Global Tours to Extended City Residencies**

A growing number of prominent musicians are moving away from traditional world tours in favor of longer performance engagements in a select few major cities. This strategic shift sees artists establishing temporary residencies, performing multiple shows in locations like Las Vegas, London, or New York, instead of traveling to dozens of international destinations.

Industry analysts note this model reduces the extensive logistical demands and physical strain of constant travel for performers and their crews. For fans, it can concentrate ticket availability in specific hubs but may limit access for those living outside key markets. The change is part of a broader reassessment of touring economics and artist sustainability in the post-pandemic live music landscape.

Key points:
*   Several top artists are choosing multi-show residencies in major cities over conventional global tours.
*   This approach aims to lessen the burdens of frequent travel while consolidating production efforts.
*   The trend reflects an industry-wide evaluation of touring logistics and long-term career management.
