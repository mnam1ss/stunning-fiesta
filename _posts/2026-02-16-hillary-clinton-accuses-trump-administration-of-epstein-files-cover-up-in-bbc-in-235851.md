In a recent BBC interview, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alleged that the Trump administration is deliberately delaying the release of documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. She called for the immediate disclosure of the files, suggesting the process is being obstructed.

In response, a White House spokesperson defended the administration's record, stating it has taken more substantive action to support Epstein's victims than previous Democratic leadership. The exchange highlights ongoing political tensions surrounding the case, which involves allegations of a sex trafficking ring implicating numerous high-profile individuals.

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide, but it has fueled widespread conspiracy theories and demands for full transparency regarding his associates.

Key points:
* Hillary Clinton has publicly accused the prior administration of impeding the release of Epstein-related documents.
* The White House countered, claiming it has achieved more for victims than opposing politicians.
* Epstein's 2019 death and the unresolved questions continue to drive calls for a full public accounting.
