Parents of two children have told the BBC that their warnings about an individual at a nursery were dismissed by staff. The parents allege they raised concerns about Vincent Chan, who has since been identified as an abuser, but felt their reports were not taken seriously.

The BBC report details the parents' account of attempting to alert the nursery to potential risks. They state that their efforts to communicate their worries were met with a lack of adequate response, leaving them feeling ignored. The nursery in question has not publicly commented on the specific allegations.

The case raises questions about safeguarding procedures and the responsiveness of childcare facilities to concerns raised by families.

Key points:
- Parents allege they warned a nursery about Vincent Chan before his abuse was known.
- They state their concerns were dismissed, making them feel ignored.
- The report highlights broader questions about safeguarding protocols in childcare settings.
