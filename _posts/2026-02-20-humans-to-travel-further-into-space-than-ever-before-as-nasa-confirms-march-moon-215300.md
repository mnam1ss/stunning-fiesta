NASA has scheduled the launch of its Artemis II mission for March 2025, a crewed flight that will send astronauts farther from Earth than any human has traveled in over 50 years. The announcement follows the completion of a critical pre-launch test at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mission will carry four astronauts on a journey around the Moon, marking a significant step toward returning humans to the lunar surface. The crew will not land but will test spacecraft systems in deep space, paving the way for future Artemis missions aimed at establishing a sustained lunar presence.

This flight represents the first crewed mission of NASA's broader Artemis program, which intends to use the Moon as a proving ground for eventual human exploration of Mars.

Key points:
- The Artemis II mission launch is set for March 2025.
- The crew will orbit the Moon, traveling farther into space than any humans since the Apollo program.
- The flight is a critical test for systems needed for future lunar landings and Mars exploration.
