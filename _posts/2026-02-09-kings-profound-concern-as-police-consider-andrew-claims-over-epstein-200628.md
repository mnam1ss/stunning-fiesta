King Charles has expressed significant concern regarding allegations involving his brother, Prince Andrew, and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. This marks the monarch's first public statement on the matter as law enforcement agencies review the claims. Buckingham Palace confirmed the King is prepared to cooperate with any official police investigation that may arise from the ongoing review.

The development follows the release of court documents earlier this year that named Prince Andrew in connection with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prince Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing and previously settled a civil sexual assault case in the United States. The Metropolitan Police have stated they are assessing the recently released information but have not yet opened a formal investigation.

Key points:
- King Charles has stated his concern and willingness to assist police regarding allegations linking Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein.
- This is the King's first direct comment on the Epstein scandal since the latest court document release.
- London's Metropolitan Police are currently evaluating the information but have not launched a new criminal inquiry.
