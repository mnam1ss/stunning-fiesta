**Civil Rights Leader’s Legacy Spanned Grassroots Activism to National Policy**

A prominent figure from the US civil rights movement, whose work began in Southern churches, is being recognized for a career that extended into the highest levels of government. The activist, who later served in political office, played a significant role in shaping national conversations and legislation around equality and justice. Historical accounts note their early efforts were crucial in mobilizing communities at the local level, employing strategies of nonviolent protest and voter mobilization. This foundational work provided a platform for later influence within the federal government, including advisory roles and direct advocacy to multiple presidential administrations. Observers credit this dual-path career with helping to translate the goals of the civil rights era into enduring institutional and social changes.

**Key points:**
-   Career evolved from local community organizing in the South to federal political engagement.
