Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called for an apology from businessman Sir Jim Ratcliffe following remarks the Manchester United co-owner made about the United Kingdom. The comments, which suggested the country had been colonized, were described by the Prime Minister as offensive and incorrect.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a prominent industrialist and investor, made the statement in a recent interview. The Prime Minister’s office issued a response, stating such characterizations are damaging and do not reflect the nation's status or history. The call for an apology highlights the government's stance on public discourse from high-profile figures.

No public apology from Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been issued at this time. The businessman has not yet commented further on the Prime Minister's statement.

Key points:
