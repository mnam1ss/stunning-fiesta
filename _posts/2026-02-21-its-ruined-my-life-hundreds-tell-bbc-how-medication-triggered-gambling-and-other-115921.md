A BBC investigation has found that hundreds of individuals have reported severe behavioral side effects after taking certain prescription medications. The news organization states it was contacted by more than 250 people who described experiencing new, impulsive behaviors, including compulsive gambling, after beginning their drug regimens.

Many of those who shared their accounts reported that the onset of these behaviors was sudden and directly linked to starting the medication. They described significant personal and financial consequences as a result. The BBC's report highlights ongoing patient concerns regarding these potential adverse effects, which are noted in official prescribing information for some drugs.

Key points:
- Over 250 individuals reported new impulsive behaviors, such as gambling, after starting prescription drugs.
- Patients linked severe personal and financial distress directly to these medication side effects.
- The report brings attention to documented but potentially under-recognized risks associated with certain medications.
