A group of United States lawmakers has called for Prince Andrew to provide testimony regarding recently unsealed court documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The request follows a statement from Buckingham Palace indicating that the Royal Family is prepared to cooperate with any official law enforcement investigations.

The documents, released as part of a settled civil case, contain numerous names of individuals associated with Epstein, though their inclusion does not necessarily imply wrongdoing. Prince Andrew has previously denied allegations of misconduct and settled a civil sexual assault case in the United States in 2022 without admitting liability. The lawmakers' appeal adds to ongoing public and media scrutiny of the connections between Epstein's associates and various high-profile figures.

Key points:
* US legislators are requesting Prince Andrew's testimony concerning the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
* The request follows a royal statement of readiness to assist with any formal police inquiries.
* Prince Andrew has previously settled a related civil case while maintaining his innocence.
