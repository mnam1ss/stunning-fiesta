In a recent conversation, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for caution regarding U.S. arms transfers to Taiwan during a call with former U.S. President Donald Trump. The discussion occurred against a backdrop of increased diplomatic engagement, as several high-level officials from Western nations have traveled to China for talks in recent weeks. The communication highlights the ongoing sensitivity of the Taiwan issue in Sino-American relations, a longstanding point of contention where China asserts sovereignty over the island. The dialogue is seen as part of continued efforts to manage this critical aspect of the bilateral relationship.

Key points:
- President Xi Jinping advised prudence in U.S. weapons provisions to Taiwan during a call with former President Trump.
- The exchange follows a series of diplomatic visits to China by Western leaders in recent months.
