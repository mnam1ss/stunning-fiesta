A legislative proposal to reintroduce capital punishment for certain acts of terrorism has sparked significant debate in Israel. The bill, advanced by a group of lawmakers, specifically targets individuals convicted of deadly attacks motivated by nationalism. Proponents argue the measure is a necessary deterrent and a matter of justice for victims' families.

Opponents, including some government ministers and legal experts, strongly criticize the initiative. They raise concerns about potential misuse, the risk of exacerbating regional tensions, and ethical objections to state executions. The proposal has also drawn international attention regarding its potential application.

The Knesset is expected to further discuss the bill, though its passage remains uncertain amid the divided opinions.

Key points:
*   A new bill proposes applying the death penalty for nationalist-motivated murders.
*   Supporters view it as a deterrent, while critics warn of legal and diplomatic consequences.
*   The legislation faces an uncertain future in Israel's parliament.
