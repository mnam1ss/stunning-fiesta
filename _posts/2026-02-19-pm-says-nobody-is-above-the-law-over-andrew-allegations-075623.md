**Prime Minister Stresses Rule of Law Amid Royal Allegations**

The Prime Minister has publicly stated that the principle that "nobody is above the law" applies to recent allegations concerning Prince Andrew. The comment was made in response to media questions, though the Prime Minister did not comment directly on the specific case.

Law enforcement authorities are reportedly assessing allegations made against the Duke of York. The nature of these allegations has not been detailed in official statements. Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied any misconduct in relation to the claims.

The development follows a recent civil settlement in a related US case, which did not involve admissions of liability from the Prince. The situation continues to draw significant public and media attention regarding the intersection of legal processes and public figures.

Key points:
*   The Prime Minister emphasized the universal application of the law when asked about allegations involving Prince Andrew.
*   Police are in a phase of evaluating the claims, while the Duke of York maintains his denial of wrongdoing.
*   The allegations remain under scrutiny following a prior out-of-court settlement in a separate civil matter.
