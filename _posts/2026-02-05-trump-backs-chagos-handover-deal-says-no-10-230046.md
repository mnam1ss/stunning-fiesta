**UK Government Reports US Support for Chagos Agreement**

The UK government has stated that former US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his support for a diplomatic agreement concerning the Chagos Archipelago. This development follows public remarks last month in which Mr. Trump indicated he might reconsider his position on the deal. The agreement centers on the future sovereignty of the islands, a long-disputed territory in the Indian Ocean.

The UK and Mauritius have been engaged in negotiations regarding the archipelago, which houses a strategically significant US military base on Diego Garcia. The recent communication from London aims to clarify the US stance ahead of continued diplomatic discussions.

**Key points:**
*   The UK government confirms former President Trump's current backing of the Chagos handover agreement.
*   This statement comes after previous comments from Mr. Trump suggested potential withdrawal of support.
*   The deal involves sovereignty talks between the UK and Mauritius over the islands, which host a key US military facility.
