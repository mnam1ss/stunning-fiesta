A recent release of millions of pages of documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein has provided new material for public review. The documents, which are part of a settled civil case, contain approximately three million pages of records. Among the contents are numerous references to former U.S. President Donald Trump. The files also include email correspondence between Epstein and an individual identified in the records as "The Duke." The document dump follows a court order and is being analyzed by journalists and researchers. The materials are expected to contribute to the ongoing public examination of Epstein's network, though many names mentioned are not accused of any wrongdoing.

Key points:
*   The document release contains roughly three million pages from a settled lawsuit.
*   The records include multiple mentions of Donald Trump and emails to a person called "The Duke."
*   The materials are now public due to a judicial mandate and are under review.
