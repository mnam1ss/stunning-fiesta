A significant number of Labour Members of Parliament are reportedly expressing strong discontent with the party's current leadership. According to internal sources, this frustration is directed at both former minister Peter Mandelson and, more pointedly, at current leader Sir Keir Starmer.

The discontent stems from ongoing internal party dynamics and strategic disagreements. While reactions to Mandelson have been noted, the deeper concern among several Labour insiders focuses on Sir Keir's leadership.
