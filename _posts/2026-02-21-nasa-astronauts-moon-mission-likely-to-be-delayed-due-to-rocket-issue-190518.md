NASA's planned crewed mission to orbit the Moon is expected to face a schedule postponement following the identification of technical issues with its launch vehicle. According to a statement from a space agency official, engineers discovered problems with the rocket during preparations, necessitating further analysis and likely adjustments to the timeline. The mission, which aims to carry astronauts on a journey around the far side of the Moon, represents a critical step in the Artemis program leading to future lunar surface landings.

Officials have not provided a new target launch date, stating that teams are currently assessing the required work to resolve the rocket's technical concerns. The delay underscores the complex challenges inherent in human spaceflight missions, where safety and system reliability are paramount. NASA plans to release more details following the completion of the ongoing engineering review.

Key points:
• NASA's upcoming crewed lunar orbital mission is likely to be delayed.
• The postponement is due to technical problems identified with the mission's rocket.
• The agency is evaluating the issues and has not yet set a new launch date.
