Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has commented on the ongoing controversy surrounding Labour Party donor Frank Mandelson, stating the situation presents a significant challenge for current leader Sir Keir Starmer. Brown characterized the matter as serious for the party but expressed his confidence in Starmer's personal integrity, describing him as a principled leader.

While offering his support, Brown also suggested that Sir Keir's response to the allegations may not have been as swift as it could have been. He emphasized his belief that the Labour leader is committed to implementing necessary reforms within the party's systems.

The remarks come amid scrutiny of Labour's fundraising practices and its vetting procedures for major financial backers.

Key points:
- Gordon Brown stated the Mandelson donor issue is a serious matter for Labour leader Keir Starmer.
- Brown publicly backed Starmer's integrity and his pledge to reform party systems.
- The former PM noted Starmer's response to the scandal may have initially lacked speed.
