Ukrainian civilians are preparing for a severe cold snap, with temperatures forecast to drop as low as -20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country. This comes despite a reported truce on energy infrastructure attacks, as many residents continue to experience frequent electricity outages. The persistent power cuts are severely hampering people's ability to heat their homes during the extreme weather.

Local officials and aid organizations have expressed deep concern over the situation, warning of a potential humanitarian crisis. Many households rely on electric heating, and the lack of a consistent power supply forces them to seek alternative, often less effective, methods to stay warm. The combination of freezing temperatures and damaged energy systems poses a significant challenge to civilian safety.

Key points:
* Temperatures are predicted to plummet to -20°C in Ukraine amid ongoing power shortages.
* Electricity cuts persist despite reports of a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure.
* Aid groups warn the situation could lead to a severe humanitarian emergency this winter.
