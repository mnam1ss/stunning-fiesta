Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced new government proposals aimed at increasing protections for children online. The plans involve stricter regulation of social media platforms, with a specific focus on what the Prime Minister described as "addictive elements" within their designs and algorithms.

Speaking on the initiative, Mr. Starmer stated that the forthcoming rules would ensure no digital service operates without accountability for the safety of younger users. The measures are intended to compel platforms to alter features that may contribute to excessive or harmful usage by minors. Further details regarding the specific regulatory requirements and potential penalties for non-compliance are expected to be released in the coming weeks.

Key points:
*   New government plans will enforce stricter child safety rules for online platforms.
*   Regulations will target addictive design features in social media.
*   Prime Minister Keir Starmer says no platform will avoid accountability under the proposed rules.
