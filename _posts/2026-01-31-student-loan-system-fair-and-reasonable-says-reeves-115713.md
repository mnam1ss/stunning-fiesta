Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended the government's current student loan system, describing it as "fair and reasonable." The statement follows recent criticism from consumer finance expert Martin Lewis, who characterized a recent freeze on student loan repayment thresholds as an ethically questionable policy.

The chancellor's remarks aim to address growing public debate over the financial burden on graduates. The policy in question maintains the income level at which graduates begin repaying their loans, effectively meaning some will pay more as wages rise with inflation. Critics argue this move increases the long-term cost for borrowers.

Reeves's defence emphasizes the government's view that the existing framework balances the cost of higher education with fiscal responsibility. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions in education funding policy between affordability for students and sustainability for public finances.

Key points:
- Chancellor Rachel Reeves has publicly stated the student loan system is equitable.
- Her comments respond to criticism from Martin Lewis regarding a freeze on repayment thresholds.
- The policy debate centers on the balance between graduate costs and government finances.
