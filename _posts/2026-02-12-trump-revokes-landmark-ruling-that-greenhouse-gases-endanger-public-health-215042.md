**Administration Reverses Climate Regulation on Greenhouse Gases**

The White House has formally revoked a long-standing regulatory determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Officials described the move as a significant deregulatory action aimed at reducing compliance burdens on industry.

The original finding, established over a decade ago, served as the legal foundation for numerous federal climate policies, including vehicle emissions standards and power plant regulations. Its removal limits the federal government's authority to enact similar wide-ranging climate rules under existing statutes.

Environmental groups have strongly criticized the decision, arguing it will lead to increased air pollution and associated public health costs over time. They contend the reversal disregards established climate science. Supporters of the action state it eliminates what they view as regulatory overreach and will spur economic growth.

Key points:
*   The action withdraws the legal basis that greenhouse gases pose a public health threat, a finding in place since 2009.
*   Proponents frame it as major deregulation to aid industry, while opponents warn of negative health and environmental consequences.
*   The change restricts the potential for future broad climate regulations under current laws without congressional action.
