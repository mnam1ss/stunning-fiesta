A BBC investigation has uncovered a covert industry in which individuals film women at night without their consent and profit from the footage. The broadcaster conducted an undercover operation to examine the practice, which involves capturing video of women in public places after dark. The footage is then reportedly sold or distributed online.

The investigation revealed that those filming often operate discreetly to avoid detection, leaving the subjects unaware they are being recorded. This raises significant concerns about privacy and the legal boundaries surrounding surveillance in public spaces. The report did not specify the platforms or exact methods used to monetize the videos.

Key points:
- An undercover BBC probe found individuals secretly filming women at night for profit.
- The women filmed are reportedly unaware of the recording or its commercial use.
- The practice prompts questions about privacy laws and consent in public areas.
