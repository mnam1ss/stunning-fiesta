Exit polls indicate Japan's governing coalition, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is poised for a significant victory in the nation's parliamentary election. The coalition, which includes the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party, appears to have secured a strong majority of seats. This result, if confirmed by the final vote count, would grant the government a stable mandate to pursue its policy agenda.

The election was widely viewed as a referendum on the current administration's economic and security policies. Voter turnout was reported to be steady throughout the day. Official results are expected to be announced in the coming hours, following the completion of the ballot count.

Key points:
*   Exit polls project a decisive win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's ruling coalition.
*   The anticipated result would provide a stable parliamentary majority for the government.
*   Final official results from the parliamentary election are pending.
