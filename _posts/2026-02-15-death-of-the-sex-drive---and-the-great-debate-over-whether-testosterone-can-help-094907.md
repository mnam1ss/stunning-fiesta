A new report examines the ongoing debate surrounding the use of testosterone therapy to address declining libido in adults. While some clinicians and patients advocate for its use to counteract a natural drop in hormone levels with age, others in the medical community urge caution. They point to a complex mix of factors influencing sex drive and question the extent of the treatment's proven benefits beyond a placebo effect. The discussion also involves scrutiny of the growing market for testosterone supplements and the motivations behind its promotion.

Key points:
- Medical opinion is divided on whether testosterone therapy effectively restores libido or if benefits are overstated.
- Critics highlight that libido is influenced by many factors beyond hormone levels alone.
- The commercial expansion of testosterone treatments has raised questions about the roles of profit and marketing in driving their use.
