British national Lindsay Foreman, currently detained in Tehran's Evin prison, has spoken about her experience in a rare phone interview. She described the prolonged detention, which she shares with her husband, as a significant mental challenge. The interview was conducted hours before an Iranian court sentenced her to ten years in prison on unspecified charges.

Her case is part of a broader pattern where foreign nationals, particularly those with dual citizenship, have been detained in Iran. Western governments have frequently criticized such arrests, alleging they are politically motivated. Iranian authorities generally state that all detainees are subject to the country's judicial processes.

Key points:
*   A British woman detained in Iran has been sentenced to ten years in prison.
*   In an interview, she characterized the detention as a severe test of mental endurance.
*   The arrest occurs amid ongoing diplomatic tensions over the detention of foreign nationals in Iran.
