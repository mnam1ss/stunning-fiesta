UK Economy Records Minimal Growth in Late 2025

The United Kingdom's economy expanded at a modest rate in the final quarter of 2025, according to newly released official statistics. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.1% during the three-month period, a figure described by analysts as subdued.

The data indicates that the production sector, specifically manufacturing output, provided the primary contribution to the quarter's growth. This marginal expansion follows a period of economic uncertainty and continues a trend of slow-paced recovery.

Economists are monitoring the figures closely as they assess the broader health of the UK economy and its trajectory heading into 2026. The minimal growth rate suggests ongoing challenges in achieving more robust economic momentum.

Key points:
* UK GDP grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025.
* The manufacturing sector was the leading factor in the expansion.
* The overall pace of growth remains slow and subdued.
