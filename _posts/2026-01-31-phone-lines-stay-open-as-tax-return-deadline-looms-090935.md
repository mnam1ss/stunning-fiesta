**Tax Helplines Remain Active Ahead of Filing Deadline**

With the annual self-assessment tax return deadline approaching, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed its telephone helplines will continue to operate. The reminder comes as officials note that a significant number of individuals failed to submit their returns by the required date last year.

The deadline for online tax returns is January 31. HMRC data indicates that over a million taxpayers missed this cutoff in the previous filing period, potentially incurring penalties. The ongoing availability of phone support is intended to assist those with last-minute queries or technical issues related to the online submission system.

Officials encourage taxpayers to complete their returns as early as possible to avoid potential last-minute system delays and automatic fines for late filing.

**Key points:**
*   HMRC tax helplines are open as the January 31 online filing deadline nears.
*   More than one million people missed the submission deadline last tax year.
*   Late filers can face automatic financial penalties.
