**War Widow Relocates Husband's Grave Amid Russian Advances**

A Ukrainian woman has exhumed and moved her husband's remains from their hometown near the front lines to the capital, Kyiv, citing fears of a Russian military advance. Natalia, whose husband was killed earlier in the war, reportedly made the decision as Russian forces have recently captured several villages in the eastern Kharkiv region.

The reburial, which required official permissions, was conducted to prevent the potential seizure of the gravesite by advancing troops. Local authorities in the Kyiv region assisted with the interment in a safer location. This action underscores the deepening humanitarian impact of the renewed Russian offensive, which has displaced thousands of civilians and created widespread anxiety over territorial control.

Key points:
*   A Ukrainian widow relocated her deceased husband's grave from a conflict zone to Kyiv.
*   The move was prompted by recent Russian military gains in the Kharkiv region.
*   The reburial highlights civilian efforts to secure personal legacies amid ongoing hostilities.
