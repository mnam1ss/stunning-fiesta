EU Commissioner Expresses Willingness to Discuss UK Customs Union

European Union Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis has stated the bloc maintains an open position regarding a potential debate on a UK customs union arrangement. The comments come as the EU signals a readiness for dialogue with Britain against a backdrop of increasing international economic and political instability.

Commissioner Dombrovskis emphasized the EU's continued engagement with the UK on trade matters, noting the importance of stable economic relations. This stance follows the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement, with some UK political and business figures periodically calling for closer trade alignment to reduce barriers. The EU's declared openness is framed within the existing agreements and structures governing the UK-EU relationship.

Key points:
- The EU's trade commissioner has indicated a flexible approach to discussions about a customs union with the UK.
- This willingness for dialogue is partly motivated by growing global economic uncertainties.
- Any potential talks would occur within the framework of the existing post-Brexit agreements.
