The US Department of Justice has removed thousands of documents from its public website related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The removal follows the identification of victims whose names and personal images were included without proper redaction in a recent document release. The disclosure has drawn criticism from victims and their legal representatives, who argue the unredacted information constitutes a breach of privacy and could cause further distress.

Officials stated the documents were taken offline to address the privacy concerns and to ensure proper redactions are applied before any republication. The documents are part of a broader ongoing release of materials from a settled civil case connected to Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Key points:
*   Thousands of Epstein case documents were removed from a government website after victims were identified.
*   The removal was due to the inclusion of unredacted names and images, prompting criticism from victims.
*   The Justice Department stated the takedown was to address privacy issues before a future republication.
