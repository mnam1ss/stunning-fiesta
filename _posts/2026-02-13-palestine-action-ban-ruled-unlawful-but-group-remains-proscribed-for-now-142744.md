A UK court has ruled that the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action was unlawful. In a judgment delivered on Wednesday, three High Court judges found that the Home Office had erred in its process for banning the organization.

The ruling represents a significant legal setback for the government, which had designated the group as a terrorist organization earlier this year. The judges, however, stated that the proscription order must remain in effect for the time being. This maintains the group's banned status pending a further court hearing to determine the final outcome.

The case will now proceed to a subsequent judicial review where the court will decide whether to formally quash the government's ban. Palestine Action is known for its direct action campaigns targeting companies it alleges are linked to Israeli military operations.

Key points:
*   A High Court ruling found the UK government's ban on Palestine Action was unlawful.
*   The group will remain proscribed until a further hearing decides the final outcome.
*   The case represents a notable legal challenge to the Home Office's proscription powers.
