A Cambridge University graduate has drawn on her personal experiences to create a successful stage production, which has now been adapted for a streaming service. Jade Franks, who worked as a cleaner during her studies, has written a play that addresses themes of social class and inequality. The work gained significant attention following its theatrical run, leading to its acquisition by Netflix for a future screen adaptation.

Franks has stated that her time performing janitorial duties while at the prestigious institution provided direct insight into the class dynamics she explores in her writing. The play’s transition from stage to screen is reported to be currently in development. Industry observers note the project adds to a growing trend of theatrical works being adapted for streaming platforms.

Key points:
*   A Cambridge alumna's play, inspired by her experiences with classism while working as a student cleaner, has been optioned by Netflix.
*   The theatrical production achieved notable success before attracting interest for adaptation.
*   The project is part of a broader pattern of stage works being developed for streaming audiences.
