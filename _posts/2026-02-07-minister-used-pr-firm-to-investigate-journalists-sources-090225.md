Cabinet Office Minister Josh Simons authorized the use of a private public relations firm to investigate the sources of journalists in 2023, according to a recent report. The firm, APCO Worldwide, was commissioned to conduct the inquiry, which examined how certain media outlets obtained sensitive government information. The investigation's specific findings and the total cost to the public have not been disclosed. A government spokesperson stated that ministers have a responsibility to protect official information, but declined to comment further on the details of the contracted work. The report has prompted questions from transparency advocates about the appropriateness of using external firms for such internal inquiries.

Key points:
- A Cabinet minister approved the hiring of an external PR firm to look into journalists' confidential sources.
- The investigation was carried out in 2023, but its full results and cost remain undisclosed.
- The action has raised concerns among groups focused on government transparency and media freedom.
