Federal investigators are examining a glove recovered near the home of a person of interest in an ongoing case. According to the FBI, the item was discovered in a field several miles from the individual's residence. Laboratory analysis has reportedly obtained a genetic profile from the recovered evidence.

Authorities state the glove appears visually similar to those seen in a previously released video footage featuring the suspect. The examination is part of the procedural evidence-gathering process in the investigation. No further details regarding the nature of the case or the identity of the individual have been disclosed by officials at this time.

Key points:
*   The FBI has collected a glove from a field near a suspect's home and obtained DNA from it.
*   Investigators note the glove's appearance matches that of gloves worn by a suspect in released video.
*   The analysis is a standard part of the ongoing investigation, with few additional details currently available.
