Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to provide testimony to the House Oversight Committee regarding their past associations with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. This decision comes after months of legal contention, during which their representatives challenged the validity of the committee's subpoenas. The committee had been preparing to hold a vote on whether to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for their initial non-compliance.

The agreement to cooperate averts an immediate escalation in the standoff between the committee and the former first couple. The investigation is part of a broader congressional inquiry into Epstein’s network and the handling of his case by various institutions. Details regarding the format and timing of the testimony have not yet been finalized.

Key points:
- Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify after previously contesting congressional subpoenas.
- The House Oversight Committee was preparing a contempt vote prior to this agreement.
- The testimony is connected to the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s associates.
