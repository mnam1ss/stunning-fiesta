**Labour Leader Urges Royal Cooperation with US Inquiry**

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has stated that the Duke of York should provide testimony to the United States Congress regarding his association with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The suggestion follows the recent publication of new photographs showing the Duke with Epstein.

Sir Keir emphasized the importance of transparency and cooperation with the ongoing American investigations into the Epstein case. He indicated that such a step would be a matter of fulfilling one's civic duty. The Duke has previously settled a civil sexual assault case in the US, denying the allegations. Buckingham Palace has historically stated that the Duke’s ties to Epstein were a “mistake and an error of judgement.”

Key points:
*   Sir Keir Starmer believes the Duke of York should testify before US Congress concerning Jeffrey Epstein.
*   The statement was prompted by the release of new photographs featuring the Duke and the financier.
*   The Duke previously settled a related civil case and has denied any wrongdoing.
