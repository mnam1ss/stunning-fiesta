Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to address a meeting of Labour MPs this week, an event that comes amid ongoing discussions about his leadership. The gathering follows a period of internal party scrutiny regarding the government's direction and policy agenda.

Several senior members of the Cabinet have publicly reaffirmed their backing for the Prime Minister ahead of this meeting. This show of support from top government figures is seen as a significant moment as the Labour parliamentary group prepares to convene.

The meeting is widely viewed as a critical forum for MPs to express their views directly to the party leader. Political observers note that such sessions are a routine part of parliamentary party management but can carry increased weight during periods of political challenge.

Key points:
*   Prime Minister Keir Starmer will soon speak to the parliamentary Labour Party.
*   A number of Cabinet ministers have declared their support for him prior to the meeting.
*   The session is considered an important opportunity for MPs to engage with the party leader.
