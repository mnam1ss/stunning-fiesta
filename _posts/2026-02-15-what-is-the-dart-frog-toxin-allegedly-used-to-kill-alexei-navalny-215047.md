**Report Examines Toxin Allegedly Linked to Navalny Death**

A recent report has brought attention to the substance allegedly used in the death of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny. According to the analysis, the compound in question is epibatidine, a potent neurotoxin.

Epibatidine is a natural alkaloid originally identified in the skin of certain poison dart frogs native to South American rainforests. While it exists in these amphibians, the compound can also be synthesized artificially in laboratory settings. Its high toxicity affects the nervous system by interfering with specific receptor functions.

The circumstances surrounding the procurement and use of the substance remain under investigation by international bodies. The report contributes to the technical discussion of the case but does not confirm the exact origins of the toxin allegedly involved.

**Key points:**
*   The alleged toxin is identified as epibatidine, a powerful neurotoxin.
*   It occurs naturally in some poison dart frogs but can be produced synthetically.
*   Investigations into its alleged application are ongoing.
