Parents of two victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster have initiated a new effort to amend official legal documents from the 1990s. Jenni and Trevor Hicks, whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, were among the 97 people who died in the stadium tragedy, are campaigning to have the court records altered. The documents in question are from a 1990s legal case and reportedly contain what the family describes as inaccurate and distressing information about their daughters.

The Hicks family has long been involved in campaigns for accountability following the disaster, which occurred during an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. This latest action is described by the parents as a final step in their long pursuit of justice and accurate historical documentation. The campaign seeks a formal correction from the relevant judicial authorities.

Key points:
*   Jenni and Trevor Hicks are campaigning to correct 1990s court records concerning their daughters, who died at Hillsborough.
*   The parents state the official documents contain inaccuracies about Sarah and Victoria Hicks.
*   This effort is part of their long-standing pursuit of accurate records following the 1989 disaster.
