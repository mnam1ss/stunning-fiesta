BBC Health Correspondent James Gallagher recently underwent a personal blood analysis to investigate the physiological impact of air pollution. The report documents his participation in a scientific study aimed at tracing the path and effects of airborne particles once they enter the human body.

Researchers analyzed his blood for specific biomarkers linked to inflammation and cardiovascular stress, which are associated with exposure to common pollutants like particulate matter. The findings from this individual case are part of a broader body of evidence connecting air pollution to serious health outcomes, including heart disease and stroke. The correspondent's personal results reportedly showed detectable levels of such biomarkers, illustrating the direct, though often invisible, biological response to polluted air.

Key points:
* A BBC health correspondent participated in a blood analysis to trace the biological impact of air pollution.
* The study looked for biomarkers of inflammation and cardiovascular stress linked to pollutant exposure.
* The personal results demonstrated detectable biological changes, highlighting pollution's direct effect on the body.
