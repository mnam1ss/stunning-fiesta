White House Removes Social Media Post After Bipartisan Criticism

The White House has taken down a social media post that included a video clip widely condemned as racist. The original post, which featured a manipulated video depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, was met with swift criticism from lawmakers in both major political parties. Initially, White House officials defended the content, urging critics to dismiss the controversy as unfounded. Following the removal, no additional official statement has been issued regarding the decision.

The incident has sparked renewed debate over the use of social media by political figures and the dissemination of altered media. The video's removal comes after a period of sustained public and political pressure.

Key points:
*   A White House social media post containing a controversial video has been deleted.
*   The post faced bipartisan condemnation before its removal.
*   The deletion follows initial defense of the content by administration officials.
