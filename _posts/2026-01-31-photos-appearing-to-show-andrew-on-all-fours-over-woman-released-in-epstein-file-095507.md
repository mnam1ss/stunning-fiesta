Newly released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein case include photographs that appear to depict Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, positioned on all fours over a woman. The images were made public as part of a broader disclosure of legal materials related to the late financier.

This development adds to the prolonged public and media scrutiny surrounding the prince's association with Epstein. Prince Andrew has consistently denied any misconduct or illegal activity in connection with his past interactions with the financier. The release of these photographs is expected to renew questions about the nature of his relationship with Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

Key points:
- Photographs appearing to show Prince Andrew in a compromising position have emerged from Epstein case files.
- The prince has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing related to his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
- The release continues years of intense public examination of the royal's links to the disgraced financier.
