Ukraine has enacted a new law providing state funding for military personnel to preserve their reproductive cells. The measure allows eligible troops to freeze their sperm or eggs at no personal cost. Officials cite the country's ongoing demographic challenges as a primary reason for the policy, as the population has declined significantly in recent years.

The legislation is framed as a way to support soldiers' future family planning amid the uncertainties of wartime service. It aims to address long-term population concerns by offering service members an option to potentially have biological children after their deployment. The government will cover the expenses associated with the cryopreservation process and storage for a defined period.

Key points:
*   Ukraine will fund the freezing of eggs or sperm for its military personnel.
*   The policy is linked to broader efforts to counter a sharp national population decline.
*   The state will cover the costs of the preservation procedures for eligible troops.
