European leaders are convening in Munich this week for a major annual security forum, with discussions expected to be dominated by the future of transatlantic relations. The conference occurs amid ongoing debate within Europe about its defense capabilities and strategic autonomy.

The political landscape in the United States, including the potential for a second Trump administration, is influencing these security calculations. European officials are assessing how to bolster continental defense cooperation and industrial capacity. The war in Ukraine remains a central topic, with continued military support for Kyiv a key priority for many attendees.

The gathering serves as a barometer for alliance cohesion as participants navigate a period of geopolitical uncertainty and evolving threats.

**Key points:**
*   The Munich Security Conference opens this week with European defense strategy a primary focus.
*   The potential shift in U.S. foreign policy is a significant factor in European security planning.
*   Support for Ukraine and discussions on increasing European military independence are on the agenda.
