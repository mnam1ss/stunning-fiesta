A new report on gender identity services for young people in England has raised concerns about the impact of intense public debate on children. The author of the review, Dr. Hilary Cass, stated that children are being used as a tool by opposing sides in discussions about transgender issues. She noted that positions held by activists on both ends of the spectrum have resulted in significant harm and anxiety for vulnerable youth.

The independent report, which examined healthcare pathways, calls for a more cautious and evidence-based approach to supporting young people questioning their gender. It emphasizes the need for robust research and comprehensive care that addresses mental health alongside any gender-related distress.

Key points:
* The report's author states children have been negatively affected by being drawn into a polarized public debate.
* The review recommends a more careful, evidence-led model for gender identity services for youth.
* It highlights a current lack of long-term research on outcomes for young people receiving gender-related medical interventions.
