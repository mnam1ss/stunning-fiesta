Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a warning that a broader regional conflict could occur if the United States initiates military action against Iran. The statement follows recent remarks by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who indicated that Iran was engaged in what he described as significant negotiations. The warning comes as Iran prepares to conduct a live-fire naval drill in a major international shipping corridor.

Tensions in the region have been elevated for years, often centering on Iran's nuclear program and its military activities. The planned military exercise is seen by analysts as a demonstration of Iran's naval capabilities in a strategically vital waterway. International observers are monitoring the situation closely, concerned about the potential for miscalculation or escalation between the long-standing adversaries.

Key points:
- Iran's leader cautioned that a U.S. attack could lead to a wider regional war.
- The warning coincides with Iran's upcoming live-fire naval exercise in a key shipping route.
- The remarks follow a statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding discussions with Iran.
