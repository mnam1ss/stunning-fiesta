Two teenagers have been found guilty of killing a man they mistakenly believed was a paedophile. The incident occurred when the pair, whose identities are protected due to their age, pursued Alexander Cashford. During the confrontation, the victim was struck with multiple objects, including rocks and a glass bottle. The assault led to fatal injuries from which Cashford later died. The verdict was delivered at a youth court following an investigation into the circumstances of the attack. Authorities have stated the belief about the victim was entirely unfounded. The sentencing for the two convicted individuals is scheduled for a later date.

Key points:
* Two youths convicted for the fatal assault of Alexander Cashford.
* The attack was motivated by an incorrect assumption about the victim.
* Sentencing will occur at a future court hearing.
