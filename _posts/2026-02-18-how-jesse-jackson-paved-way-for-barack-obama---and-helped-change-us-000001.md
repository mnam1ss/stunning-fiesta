Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson is widely credited with helping to establish a political foundation that later enabled Barack Obama's historic presidential campaign. Jackson's influence, which grew from his early work in Southern churches, extended through national politics for decades.

His 1984 and 1988 campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination mobilized a broad coalition of minority and progressive voters, demonstrating the electoral power of these groups. While he did not secure the nomination, his efforts are seen by political analysts as a crucial step in making a national campaign by a Black candidate viable. This work is considered to have changed the landscape of American politics, paving a path that future candidates would follow.

Key points:
*   Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns in the 1980s mobilized new voter coalitions.
*   His work is viewed as a significant step toward making a successful national Black candidacy possible.
*   Analysts credit his activism with influencing the political landscape that led to Barack Obama's election.
