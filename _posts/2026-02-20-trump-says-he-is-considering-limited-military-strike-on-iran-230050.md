President Trump has stated he is weighing a targeted military action against Iran, according to recent remarks. This declaration follows a prior statement in which he suggested Iran had roughly ten days to negotiate an agreement limiting its nuclear development activities.

The comments represent an escalation in rhetoric, though specific details regarding the scale or timing of any potential strike were not provided. The situation continues to draw international attention amid longstanding tensions over Iran's nuclear program and regional activities.

Key points:
- President Trump indicated he is contemplating a limited military strike on Iran.
- The threat follows an earlier implied deadline for Iran to agree to nuclear curbs.
- The remarks intensify diplomatic tensions but lack specific operational details.
