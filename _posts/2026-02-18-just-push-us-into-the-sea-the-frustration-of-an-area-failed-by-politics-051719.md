Residents of Horden, a coastal village in County Durham, express deep-seated frustration over what they describe as decades of political neglect. The community has seen a significant decline in its population, with many citing a lack of investment and unfulfilled promises from central government as primary causes. Local sentiment suggests that national political slogans and pledges have repeatedly failed to translate into tangible improvements for the area.

The village's challenges are emblematic of broader issues in some post-industrial regions, where economic decline and a perceived disconnect from Westminster decision-making persist. Community figures report a sense of abandonment, with essential services and opportunities dwindling over time. This has fueled a stark local commentary on the area's prospects.

Key points:
• Residents report long-term political neglect and unmet government promises.
• The village of Horden has experienced a notable population decline.
• Local sentiment highlights a disconnect between national pledges and on-the-ground realities.
