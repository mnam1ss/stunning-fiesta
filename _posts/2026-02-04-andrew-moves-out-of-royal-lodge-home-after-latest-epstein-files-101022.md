Prince Andrew has relocated from his long-term residence at Royal Lodge on the Windsor Estate to a smaller property. The move to a temporary home on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk follows the recent public disclosure of additional court documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke of York had been residing at the 30-room Royal Lodge under a lease agreement with the Crown Estate.

A spokesperson for the prince confirmed the change in residence but did not comment on the specific reasons behind the timing of the move. The decision is reported to have been made in consultation with King Charles III. The newly released legal filings, which name numerous associates of Epstein, have renewed public scrutiny of the prince’s past association with the convicted sex offender.

Key points:
- Prince Andrew has moved from Royal Lodge to a temporary home on the Sandringham Estate.
