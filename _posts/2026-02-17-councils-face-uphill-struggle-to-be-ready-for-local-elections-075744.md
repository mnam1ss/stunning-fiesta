**Councils Scramble to Prepare for Local Elections**

Local authorities across England are working to finalize arrangements for upcoming local elections after a government decision to proceed with the scheduled vote. Approximately thirty councils, which had been preparing for a potential postponement, must now rapidly organize polling stations, print ballots, and deploy staff.

The change in plans follows the government's abandonment of a proposal to delay the elections. This reversal has left these councils with a condensed timeline to complete all necessary logistical and administrative tasks. Officials have described the situation as a significant operational challenge, given the detailed preparations required to ensure a smooth electoral process.

The elections are expected to proceed as originally planned on their designated date.

**Key points:**
*   Approximately thirty English councils must now organize local elections following a government U-turn on a delay.
*   Authorities face a compressed timeline to arrange logistics, including staffing polling stations and preparing ballots.
*   The elections are scheduled to go ahead on their initially set date.
