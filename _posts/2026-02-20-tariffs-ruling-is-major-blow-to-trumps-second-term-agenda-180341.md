**Supreme Court Ruling Limits Presidential Authority on Tariffs**

A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision has delivered a significant setback to former President Donald Trump's stated trade policy objectives for a potential second term. The ruling curtails the executive branch's unilateral power to adjust tariffs, a tool central to Trump's previous economic agenda.

Legal analysts note the decision strengthens the role of Congress in setting trade policy, potentially complicating future administrations' ability to swiftly impose or alter import taxes. The case specifically addressed the scope of presidential authority under a Cold War-era law, with the Court finding that such powers are not without limits.

The outcome is seen as reshaping the balance of power between the White House and Congress on international economic matters, setting a new precedent for how trade disputes are managed.

Key points:
*   The Supreme Court has restricted presidential power to unilaterally set tariffs.
*   The ruling reinforces Congressional authority over trade and tariff policy.
*   The decision creates a new legal precedent affecting future trade negotiations.
