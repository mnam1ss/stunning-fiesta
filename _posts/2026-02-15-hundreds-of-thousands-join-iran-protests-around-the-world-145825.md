Protests in solidarity with ongoing demonstrations in Iran have been held in numerous cities across the globe over the weekend. Organizers and local authorities reported that several gatherings drew crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

The largest concentrations of demonstrators were observed in major cities in Germany, the United States, and Canada. Significant rallies also occurred in other international capitals, including in Israel and Portugal. Participants called for increased international attention to the situation within Iran.

The global actions appear to be a coordinated response to recent domestic events in Iran, though specific protest dynamics vary by location. Local law enforcement agencies monitored the events, which were largely reported as peaceful.

Key points:
• Major demonstrations occurred in multiple international cities, with particularly large turnouts in three North American and European hubs.
• The protests were organized to show support for recent unrest inside Iran.
• Events in host cities were reported to be peaceful, with police presence noted.
