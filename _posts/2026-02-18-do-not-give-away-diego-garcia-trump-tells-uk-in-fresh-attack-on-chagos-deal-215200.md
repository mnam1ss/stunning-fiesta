Former US President Donald Trump has publicly urged the United Kingdom not to proceed with a recent agreement concerning the Chagos Islands. The statement, made via his social media platform, directly addresses a deal that would see the UK and Mauritius resolve a long-standing dispute over sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago.

This intervention comes shortly after the current US administration formally expressed its support for the UK-Mauritius agreement. The deal includes provisions for continued US military use of the strategic Diego Garcia base, which is located on the largest island. Mr. Trump's remarks highlight differing perspectives on the issue within US political circles.

Key points:
*   Donald Trump has advised the UK against implementing its new agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands.
*   His comments follow official US government support for the same diplomatic deal.
*   The agreement aims to settle sovereignty while allowing the US military base on Diego Garcia to remain operational.
