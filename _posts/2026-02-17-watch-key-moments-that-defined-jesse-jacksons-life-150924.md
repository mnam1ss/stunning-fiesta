Civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Reverend Jesse Jackson is the subject of a new retrospective video compilation. The feature highlights pivotal events spanning his decades of public life and activism.

Jackson rose to prominence in the 1960s as a close associate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He later founded the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, an organization dedicated to social justice, economic equity, and political empowerment. In the 1980s, he mounted two historic campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, which significantly increased voter registration and political engagement among minority communities. His work in international diplomacy, including efforts to secure the release of hostages abroad, also forms a key part of his public record.

*   He was a two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s.
