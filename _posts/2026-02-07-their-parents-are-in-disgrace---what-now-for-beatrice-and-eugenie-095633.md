The public standing of the Duke and Duchess of York has prompted questions about the future roles of their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. As non-working members of the Royal Family, the sisters have pursued independent careers while maintaining a family presence at some official events. Royal commentators suggest their long-term involvement within the institution may depend on establishing their own distinct profiles, separate from their parents' controversies. The sisters have not been provided with sovereign grant funds for official duties, a factor that has shaped their current positions. Their continued participation in royal life is seen as a matter for the monarch and the sisters themselves to determine.

Key points:
* The princesses' future royal roles are under discussion following their parents' diminished status.
* They currently balance private careers with occasional family appearances at royal events.
* Their path forward is likely influenced by personal choice and decisions from senior royals.
