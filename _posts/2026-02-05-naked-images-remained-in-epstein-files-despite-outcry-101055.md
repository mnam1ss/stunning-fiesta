Newly released documents from a civil case related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein contain several unredacted photographs, according to a BBC Verify report. The images, which are part of a broader cache of evidence, reportedly depict partially clothed women. Their faces and other identifying features are not obscured in these particular pictures.

The inclusion of such unaltered material has drawn criticism from some legal observers and victim advocates, who argue it fails to protect the privacy of the individuals pictured. The documents were filed in a New York federal court as part of ongoing litigation connected to Epstein’s activities.

Key points:
*   Court documents from a Jeffrey Epstein-related case include photographs showing unredacted images of women.
*   The lack of obscuring for faces and bodies has raised privacy concerns from some quarters.
*   The materials were submitted in ongoing civil proceedings in a U.S. federal court.
