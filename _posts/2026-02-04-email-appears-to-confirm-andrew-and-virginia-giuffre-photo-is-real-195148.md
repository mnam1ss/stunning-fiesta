A newly disclosed email appears to contradict Prince Andrew’s previous statements regarding a photograph central to a civil lawsuit. The image shows the Duke of York with his arm around Virginia Giuffre, who has accused him of sexual assault, when she was a teenager. Prince Andrew has publicly questioned the photograph's authenticity, suggesting it may have been altered, and has stated he has no recollection of ever meeting Ms. Giuffre.

The email, reportedly sent by the Duke’s former private secretary, is said to acknowledge the existence of the photograph. This correspondence has emerged as part of the ongoing legal proceedings. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him. The development is likely to be reviewed as part of the wider case.

Key points:
• An email has surfaced that reportedly acknowledges a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre.
• Prince Andrew has previously questioned the image's authenticity and denied meeting his accuser.
• The document emerges amid a civil lawsuit in which the Duke denies all allegations.
