**Chief of Staff Departure Adds to Challenges for Prime Minister**

The departure of Sue Gray, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, has been announced by Downing Street. Ms. Gray, who previously served as a senior civil servant, joined the Prime Minister's team last year. Her exit comes amid a period of significant political challenges for the government.

Observers note that the loss of such a senior and experienced adviser could impact the operational effectiveness of the Prime Minister's office. The role of Chief of Staff is central to coordinating government business and strategy. This change in personnel occurs as the government faces a demanding parliamentary agenda and ongoing economic pressures.

A Downing Street spokesperson thanked Ms. Gray for her service and stated that a process to appoint a successor would begin shortly. No specific reason for her departure was provided in the official statement.

**Key points:**
*   Sue Gray has stepped down from her role as the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff.
*   The departure removes a key senior adviser during a challenging period for the government.
*   Downing Street has announced it will now seek a permanent replacement for the position.
