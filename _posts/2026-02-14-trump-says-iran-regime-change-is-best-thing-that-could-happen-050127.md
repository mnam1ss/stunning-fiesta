President Trump has stated that a change in Iran's government would be a highly favorable outcome. This remark coincides with the deployment of a second U.S. aircraft carrier group to the Middle East, a move widely seen as increasing military pressure on Tehran. The administration has cited unspecified threats from Iran as the reason for the deployment. These developments occur amidst heightened tensions following the U.S. withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran last year and the recent imposition of stricter economic sanctions. Iranian officials have consistently denounced U.S. actions and rhetoric, asserting they will not be intimidated.

Key points:
- The U.S. President expressed support for a change in Iran's leadership.
- A second U.S. carrier group is being sent to the Middle East, escalating military posture.
- Tensions remain high following the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal and new sanctions.
