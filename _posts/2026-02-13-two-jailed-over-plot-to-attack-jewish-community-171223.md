Two individuals have been sentenced to prison for planning a terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community in the United Kingdom, following a trial at the Old Bailey. The court was told the pair had developed a detailed plan inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State group. Authorities intervened before the plot could be carried out.

The investigation involved extensive surveillance and intelligence gathering by counter-terrorism police. During the trial, evidence was presented showing the defendants had taken steps to acquire weapons and conduct reconnaissance on potential locations. The judge described the planned attack as a significant threat to public safety.

Key points:
*   Two men have been imprisoned for conspiring to launch a terrorist attack on the UK's Jewish community.
*   The court found the plot was motivated by the beliefs of the Islamic State militant group.
*   Police operations prevented the attack from being executed.
