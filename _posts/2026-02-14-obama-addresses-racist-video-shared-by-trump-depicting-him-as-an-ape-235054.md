Former President Barack Obama has commented on a widely circulated racist video that depicts him as an ape, which was recently shared by former President Donald Trump on social media. In his remarks, Obama did not directly name Trump but spoke broadly about the current political climate. He expressed concern over a perceived decline in basic standards of conduct and propriety among individuals holding public office.

The video in question, which has been condemned as racist and dehumanizing, was posted to Trump's Truth Social account. Obama's response focused on the broader implications of such rhetoric, suggesting it reflects a troubling erosion of civic norms. The incident has reignited discussions about the tone of political discourse and the use of inflammatory imagery in public communications.
