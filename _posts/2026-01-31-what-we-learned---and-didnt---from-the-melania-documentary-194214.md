A new documentary film focusing on former First Lady Melania Trump has been released. Titled *Melania*, the project is directed by filmmaker Brett Ratner. The film aims to explore the personal and public life of a figure who maintained a notably private profile during her time in the White House.

Initial reviews suggest the documentary offers some new perspectives and archival footage. However, critics note that it may not provide a comprehensive or definitive portrait, with some aspects of her life and motivations remaining outside its scope. The film enters a media landscape with continued public interest in the personal dynamics of political families.

Key points:
- The documentary *Melania*, directed by Brett Ratner, examines the life of the former first lady.
- It presents some new material but is described as not fully penetrating its subject's reserved public persona.
- The release contributes to ongoing public and media scrutiny of figures from the Trump administration.
