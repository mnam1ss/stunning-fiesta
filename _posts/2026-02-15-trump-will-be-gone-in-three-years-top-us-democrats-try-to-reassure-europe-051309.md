At the Munich Security Conference this weekend, senior Democratic Party officials sought to reassure European allies about the future of the transatlantic relationship. The delegation, which included several potential future presidential candidates, emphasized a commitment to international alliances, contrasting with the "America First" foreign policy approach of the current administration.

The politicians argued that the current political climate in the United States is temporary. They conveyed a message that U.S. support for NATO and cooperative diplomacy would endure beyond the next election cycle. Their presence at the major foreign policy forum was seen as an effort to establish their foreign policy credentials and present an alternative vision for American global engagement.

Key points:
*   Senior Democrats at the Munich conference pledged continued U.S. support for international alliances.
*   The delegation positioned its cooperative approach as an alternative to "America First" policies.
*   The visit allowed potential future leaders to outline their foreign policy stance to global partners.
