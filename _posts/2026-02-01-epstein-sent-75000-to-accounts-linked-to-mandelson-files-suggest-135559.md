Newly disclosed documents appear to show that the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sent $75,000 to bank accounts associated with the former UK cabinet minister Lord Peter Mandelson. The records, which have not been independently verified, reportedly indicate the transfers occurred in the early 2000s.

In response to the report, Lord Mandelson has stated he has no memory or documentation of receiving such funds. He has also publicly questioned the authenticity of the files in question. The allegations stem from a broader release of court documents related to the Epstein estate.

Key points:
- Financial records suggest Epstein transferred funds to accounts linked to Lord Mandelson.
- Lord Mandelson denies any recollection or record of the transactions.
- The authenticity of the documents has not been independently confirmed.
