Former Business Secretary Vince Cable has called for an official inquiry into the Duke of York’s tenure as the UK’s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment. The statement follows renewed scrutiny of the former royal’s conduct in the role, which he held from 2001 until 2011.

Sir Vince, who served in the coalition government, described the alleged behavior during this period as deeply improper. He argued that the circumstances warrant a formal review to examine the activities and associations linked to the trade envoy position. The Duke of York has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his business and diplomatic activities.

The call for an investigation adds to ongoing public and political questions about the transparency and oversight of such appointed roles.

Key points:
• Vince Cable has urged a formal investigation into the Duke of York's work as a UK trade envoy.
• The former business secretary characterized the alleged conduct as improper.
• The duke has previously denied any misconduct related to his official duties.
