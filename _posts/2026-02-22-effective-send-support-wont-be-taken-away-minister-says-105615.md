Education Secretary Reaffirms Commitment to SEND Support Amid Reforms

The Education Secretary has stated that effective support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) will not be removed under the government's planned reforms. The minister emphasized the government's commitment to maintaining necessary provisions for these students.

However, the official noted that as part of the reform process, there will be a system of reviewing individual children to assess their current requirements. This process aims to ensure that support is appropriately matched to each child's specific circumstances. The comments come amidst ongoing discussions about changes to the SEND system in England, which have raised concerns among some parents and educators about the consistency of future support.

Key points:
- The Education Secretary pledges that effective SEND support will continue.
- Planned reforms will include reviews of individual children's needs.
- The statement addresses concerns over potential changes to the support system.
