**New Evidence Emerges in 2002 Murder Case**

A BBC investigation has uncovered evidence suggesting police in Bournemouth, UK, withheld information that discredited their key witness in a 2002 murder trial. Omar Benguit was convicted in 2005 for the murder of South Korean student Jong-Ok Shin, who was stabbed to death. According to the BBC's findings, officers possessed CCTV footage that contradicted the timeline provided by their sole eyewitness, a woman whose testimony was central to securing the conviction. The report indicates this footage was not disclosed to the defense at the time. Benguit, who has maintained his innocence, has had three appeals rejected. The case is now under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice.

Key points:
- BBC evidence indicates police had CCTV contradicting their key witness in Omar Benguit's murder trial.
- The undisclosed footage allegedly discredited the witness's timeline of the 2002 killing of student Jong-Ok Shin.
- The case is under official review after Benguit's previous appeals were unsuccessful.
