Police are reviewing reports of alleged misconduct following the publication of emails connected to Lord Peter Mandelson. The investigation concerns accusations that the senior Labour peer shared confidential government information with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

The emails in question were recently made public, prompting authorities to assess whether any official protocols were breached. Lord Mandelson, a former cabinet minister, has not issued a public statement regarding the specific allegations. The police assessment is a preliminary step to determine if a full formal investigation is warranted.

Key points:
- Police are assessing reports of misconduct after emails involving Lord Mandelson were published.
- He is accused of sharing sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein.
- The assessment will decide if a formal investigation is required.
