Students at several universities in Iran have held demonstrations, marking the first significant public anti-government gatherings since a period of widespread unrest was suppressed last month. The protests, which took place on multiple campuses, included acts of remembrance for individuals who lost their lives during the previous crackdown. Security forces were reportedly present at the locations.

The earlier wave of protests, which began in September, represented one of the most serious challenges to Iran's leadership in recent years. It was sparked by the death of a young woman in morality police custody and evolved into broader calls for change. Authorities moved to quell those demonstrations over several weeks.

Key points:
*   Students at Iranian universities staged new anti-government protests.
*   The gatherings honored those killed during unrest the previous month.
*   The demonstrations are the first of notable size since that crackdown.
