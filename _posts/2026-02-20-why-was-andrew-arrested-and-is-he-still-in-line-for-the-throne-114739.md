Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has been arrested by London's Metropolitan Police on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. The arrest is connected to an ongoing investigation into the activities of a foreign businessman. The prince was taken into custody for questioning and has since been released on bail pending further inquiries.

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace stated they would not be commenting on the ongoing police matter. Legal experts note that misconduct in a public office is a serious criminal offense in the United Kingdom, carrying a potential maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The arrest is unrelated to previous civil litigation settled in the United States.

The development raises questions about Prince Andrew's royal status and future public duties. He retains his title and place in the line of succession to the British throne, as these are matters of law and constitution, not subject to police investigations.

Key points:
*   Prince Andrew was arrested and questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.
*   He has been released on bail as the police investigation continues.
*   His position in the line of succession remains unchanged at this time.
