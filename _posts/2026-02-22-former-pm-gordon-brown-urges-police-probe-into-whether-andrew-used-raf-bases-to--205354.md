Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for a police investigation into whether the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, used Royal Air Force facilities for meetings with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The request centers on Andrew's tenure as a UK trade envoy and follows recent media reports about his connections.

Mr. Brown has formally urged authorities to conduct a full inquiry into the matter. The Duke of York has previously faced scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender. Buckingham Palace has not issued a statement regarding this specific call for an investigation.

Key points:
- Gordon Brown has requested a police probe into Prince Andrew's alleged use of RAF bases for meetings with Jeffrey Epstein.
- The request relates to Andrew's former role as a UK trade envoy.
- The Duke of York's past association with Epstein has been a subject of ongoing public and media attention.
