A former summer camp leader has been sentenced to over 23 years in prison for a series of sexual offenses against young boys and for drugging his wife. Jon Ruben, who admitted to the charges, was found to have administered a tranquilizer to children, often by concealing it in sweets, to facilitate the abuse.

The sentencing follows an investigation into his actions while in a position of trust. The court heard details of the abuse and the separate offense of administering a substance to his spouse without her knowledge.

**Key points:**
*   Jon Ruben received a prison sentence exceeding 23 years.
*   He admitted to sexually abusing boys and drugging his wife.
*   The abuse involved administering a tranquilizer to children, sometimes via sweets.
