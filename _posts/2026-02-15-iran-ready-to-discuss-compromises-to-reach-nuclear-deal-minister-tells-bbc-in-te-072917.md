Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi stated in an interview with the BBC that Iran is prepared to negotiate compromises to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement. The interview, conducted in Tehran, emphasized that the responsibility for advancing the stalled talks now lies with the United States. The official indicated that Tehran is waiting for Washington to demonstrate a genuine commitment to returning to the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Diplomatic efforts to restore the accord, which limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, have been at an impasse for months. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018 under the previous administration, leading Iran to gradually exceed the pact's nuclear enrichment limits. Recent indirect negotiations have struggled to bridge remaining gaps.

Key points:
*   A senior Iranian official says Iran is ready to discuss concessions to restore the nuclear deal.
*   The official placed the onus on the United States to show it wants an agreement.
*   The statement comes amid a prolonged deadlock in efforts to revive the 2015 JCPOA.
