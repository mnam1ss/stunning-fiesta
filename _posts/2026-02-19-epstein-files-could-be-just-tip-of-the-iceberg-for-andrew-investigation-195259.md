**New Developments Emerge in Prince Andrew Investigation**

Investigators are reportedly in possession of significantly more material related to the Prince Andrew case than has been made public, according to a source familiar with the matter. The comment follows the recent release of court documents from a civil case involving the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. While those filings have drawn public attention, officials are believed to have a much broader evidence base compiled during their inquiries. The Duke of York has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his association with Epstein. The situation highlights the ongoing law enforcement scrutiny surrounding individuals connected to Epstein's network, even years after his death. No new formal allegations against Prince Andrew have been announced by authorities.

Key points:
*   A source indicates police evidence in the Prince Andrew case is far more extensive than recently released documents.
*   Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied any allegations of misconduct stemming from his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
*   The investigation into Epstein's associates remains active, with authorities holding substantial unreleased information.
